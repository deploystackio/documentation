DeployStack Satellite implements outbound-only HTTP polling communication with the Backend, following the GitHub Actions runner pattern for enterprise firewall compatibility. This document describes the communication implementation from the satellite perspective.

## Communication Pattern

### HTTP Polling Architecture

Satellites initiate all communication using outbound HTTPS requests:

```
Satellite                    Backend
   │                           │
   │──── GET /commands ────────▶│  (Poll for pending commands)
   │                           │
   │◀─── Commands Response ────│  (MCP server tasks)
   │                           │
   │──── POST /heartbeat ──────▶│  (Report status, metrics)
   │                           │
   │◀─── Acknowledgment ───────│  (Confirm receipt)
```

**Firewall Benefits:**
- Works through corporate firewalls without inbound rules
- Functions behind network address translation (NAT)
- Supports corporate HTTP proxies
- No exposed satellite endpoints required

### Adaptive Polling Strategy

Satellites adjust polling frequency based on Backend guidance:

- **Immediate Mode**: 2-second intervals when urgent commands pending
- **Normal Mode**: 30-second intervals for routine operations
- **Backoff Mode**: Exponential backoff up to 5 minutes on errors
- **Maintenance Mode**: Reduced polling during maintenance windows

### Communication Channels

The satellite uses three distinct communication channels with the Backend:

**1. Command Polling (Backend → Satellite)**
- Backend creates commands, satellite polls and executes
- Adaptive intervals: 2-60 seconds based on command priority
- Used for: MCP server configuration, process management, system updates
- Direction: Backend initiates, satellite responds

**2. Heartbeat (Satellite → Backend, Periodic)**
- Satellite reports status every 30 seconds
- Contains: System metrics, process counts, resource usage
- Used for: Health monitoring, capacity planning, aggregate analytics
- Direction: Satellite reports on fixed schedule

**3. Events (Satellite → Backend, Immediate)**
- Satellite emits events when actions occur, batched every 3 seconds
- Contains: Point-in-time occurrences with precise timestamps
- Used for: Real-time UI updates, audit trails, user notifications
- Direction: Satellite reports immediately (not waiting for heartbeat)

For detailed event system documentation, see [Event System](/development/satellite/event-system).

## Communication Components

### Command Polling

**Scope-Aware Endpoints:**
- Global Satellites: `/api/satellites/global/{satelliteId}/commands`
- Team Satellites: `/api/teams/{teamId}/satellites/{satelliteId}/commands`

**Polling Optimization:**
- `X-Last-Poll` header for incremental updates
- Backend-guided polling intervals
- Command priority handling
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Status Reporting

**Heartbeat Communication:**
- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Process status for all running MCP servers
- Network information and connectivity status
- Performance metrics and error counts
- Satellite URL (first heartbeat only) - Updates backend with satellite's public URL

**Command Result Reporting:**
- Execution status and timing
- Process spawn results
- Error logs and diagnostics
- Correlation ID tracking for user feedback

## Resource Management

### System Resource Limits

**Per-Process Limits:**
- **0.1 CPU cores** maximum per MCP server process
- **100MB RAM** maximum per MCP server process
- **5-minute idle timeout** for automatic cleanup
- Maximum 50 concurrent processes per satellite

**Enforcement Methods:**
- Linux cgroups v2 for CPU and memory limits
- Process monitoring with automatic termination
- Resource usage reporting to Backend
- Early warning at 80% resource utilization

### Team Isolation

**Process-Level Isolation:**
- Dedicated system users per team (`satellite-team-123`)
- Separate process groups for complete isolation
- Team-specific directories and permissions
- Network namespace isolation (optional)

**Resource Boundaries:**
- Team-scoped resource quotas
- Isolated credential management
- Separate logging and audit trails
- Team-aware command filtering

## MCP Server Management

### Dual MCP Server Support

**stdio Subprocess Servers:**
- Local MCP servers as child processes
- JSON-RPC communication over stdio
- Process lifecycle management (spawn, monitor, terminate)
- Team isolation with dedicated system users

**HTTP Proxy Servers:**
- External MCP server endpoints
- Reverse proxy with load balancing
- Health monitoring and failover
- Request/response caching

### Process Lifecycle

**Spawn Process:**
1. Receive spawn command from Backend
2. Validate team permissions and resource limits
3. Create isolated process environment
4. Start MCP server with stdio communication
5. Report process status to Backend

**Monitor Process:**
- Continuous health checking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Automatic restart on failure
- Performance metrics collection

**Terminate Process:**
- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM
- Force kill with SIGKILL after timeout
- Resource cleanup and deallocation
- Final status report to Backend

## Internal Architecture

### Five Core Components

**1. HTTP Proxy Router**
- Team-aware request routing
- OAuth 2.1 Resource Server integration
- Load balancing across MCP server instances
- Request/response logging for audit

**2. MCP Server Manager**
- Process lifecycle management
- stdio JSON-RPC communication
- Health monitoring and restart logic
- Resource limit enforcement

**3. Team Resource Manager**

## Development Setup

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/deploystackio/deploystack.git
cd deploystack/services/satellite
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit DEPLOYSTACK_BACKEND_URL and add DEPLOYSTACK_REGISTRATION_TOKEN
# Obtain registration token from backend admin interface first

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Required environment variables
DEPLOYSTACK_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
DEPLOYSTACK_SATELLITE_NAME=dev-satellite-001
DEPLOYSTACK_REGISTRATION_TOKEN=deploystack_satellite_global_eyJhbGc...
LOG_LEVEL=debug
PORT=3001

# Optional configuration
NODE_ENV=development
DEPLOYSTACK_SATELLITE_URL=https://satellite.example.com  # Optional - auto-detected if not set
```

**Note:** `DEPLOYSTACK_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` is only required for initial satellite pairing. Once registered, satellites use their permanent API keys for all communication.

### Testing Backend Communication

```bash
# Test current connection
curl http://localhost:3001/api/status/backend

# Expected response
{
  "backend_url": "http://localhost:3000",
  "connection_status": "connected",
  "response_time_ms": 45,
  "last_check": "2025-01-05T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Database Integration

The Backend maintains satellite state in five tables:

- `satellites` - Satellite registry and configuration
- `satelliteCommands` - Command queue management
- `satelliteProcesses` - Process status tracking
- `satelliteUsageLogs` - Usage analytics and audit
- `satelliteHeartbeats` - Health monitoring data

See `services/backend/src/db/schema.ts` for complete schema definitions.

## Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow

**Registration Phase:**
1. Admin generates JWT registration token via backend API
2. Satellite includes token in Authorization header during registration
3. Backend validates token signature, scope, and expiration
4. Backend consumes single-use token and issues permanent API key
5. Satellite stores API key securely for ongoing communication

For detailed token validation process, see [Registration Security](/development/backend/satellite-communication#satellite-pairing-process).

**Operational Phase:**
1. All requests include `Authorization: Bearer {api_key}`
2. Backend validates API key and satellite scope
3. Team context extracted from satellite registration
4. Commands filtered based on team permissions

### Team Isolation Security

**Process Security:**
- Each team gets dedicated system user
- Process trees isolated with Linux namespaces
- File system permissions prevent cross-team access
- Network isolation optional for enhanced security

**Credential Management:**
- Team credentials injected into process environment
- No credential sharing between teams
- Secure credential storage and rotation
- Audit logging for all credential access

## Monitoring and Observability

### Structured Logging

**Log Context:**
```typescript
server.log.info({
  satelliteId: 'satellite-01',
  teamId: 'team-123',
  operation: 'mcp_server_spawn',
  serverId: 'filesystem-server',
  duration: '2.3s'
}, 'MCP server spawned successfully');
```

**Log Levels:**
- `trace`: Detailed communication flows
- `debug`: Development debugging
- `info`: Normal operations
- `warn`: Resource limits, restarts
- `error`: Process failures, communication errors
- `fatal`: Satellite crashes
