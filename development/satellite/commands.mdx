# Satellite Commands Reference

The satellite command system enables real-time communication between the backend and distributed satellites. Commands are stored in the `satelliteCommands` database table and processed by satellites through polling mechanisms.

## Command Architecture

### Command Structure

Each satellite command contains:

- **Command Type**: Defines the action to be performed
- **Priority Level**: Determines polling frequency and execution urgency
- **Target Satellite**: Specific satellite ID or all global satellites
- **Payload**: JSON data containing command-specific parameters
- **Expiration**: Commands expire after a defined time period

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Polling Interval | Use Case |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| `immediate` | 2 seconds | MCP installations, critical updates |
| `high` | 10 seconds | MCP deletions, configuration changes |
| `normal` | 30 seconds | Routine maintenance, non-urgent tasks |

## Command Types

### configure

**Purpose**: Triggers MCP server configuration refresh and spawning

**Priority**: `immediate` (installations/updates) or `high` (general config changes)

**Triggered By**:
- MCP server installations
- MCP server updates
- MCP server deletions
- MCP server argument modifications
- MCP server environment variable changes

**Payload Structure**:
```json
{
  "event": "mcp_installation_created|mcp_installation_updated",
  "installation_id": "installation-uuid",
  "team_id": "team-uuid"
}
```

**Satellite Actions**:
1. Fetch updated MCP server configurations from backend
2. Compare with existing configurations using hash-based change detection
3. Spawn new MCP servers based on transport type:
   - **stdio transport**: Spawn Node.js subprocess via ProcessManager
   - **HTTP transport**: Configure HTTP proxy routes
4. Terminate MCP servers for deleted installations:
   - **stdio transport**: Graceful process termination (SIGTERM â†’ SIGKILL)
   - **HTTP transport**: Remove proxy routes
5. Perform tool discovery on newly spawned/configured servers
6. Report process status to backend via team-grouped heartbeat

### restart

**Purpose**: Restarts specific MCP server processes

**Priority**: `high`

**Triggered By**:
- Manual restart requests
- Error recovery procedures
- Configuration reload requirements

**Payload Structure**:
```json
{
  "installation_id": "installation-uuid",
  "reason": "error_recovery|manual_restart|config_reload"
}
```

**Satellite Actions**:
1. Gracefully terminate existing MCP server process
2. Clear process state and temporary resources
3. Respawn MCP server with current configuration
4. Re-establish HTTP proxy routes
5. Perform health checks on restarted process

### update

**Purpose**: Updates satellite system components or configurations

**Priority**: `normal`

**Triggered By**:
- Satellite software updates
- System configuration changes
- Maintenance procedures

**Payload Structure**:
```json
{
  "component": "satellite|proxy|discovery",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "config_changes": {}
}
```

**Satellite Actions**:
1. Download and validate update packages
2. Perform backup of current state
3. Apply updates with rollback capability
4. Restart affected components
5. Verify system integrity post-update

## Command Lifecycle

### Creation

Commands are created by the `SatelliteCommandService` in the backend:

**File**: `services/backend/src/services/satelliteCommandService.ts`

**Methods**:
- `createCommandForAllGlobalSatellites()` - Broadcasts to all global satellites
- `createCommandForSpecificSatellite()` - Targets specific satellite
- `createCommandForTeamSatellites()` - Targets team-specific satellites

### Processing

Commands are processed by satellites through the command polling service:

**File**: `services/satellite/src/services/command-polling-service.ts`

**Process**:
1. Poll backend for pending commands
2. Determine polling frequency based on command priorities
3. Execute command-specific actions
4. Mark commands as completed or failed
5. Report execution results to backend

### Expiration

Commands automatically expire to prevent stale command execution:

- **Default Expiration**: 5 minutes for most commands
- **Cleanup Expiration**: 10 minutes for deletion commands
- **Update Expiration**: 30 minutes for system updates

Expired commands are ignored during processing and cleaned up by background tasks.

## Integration Points

### Backend Integration

The satellite command system integrates with MCP installation routes:

- `services/backend/src/routes/mcp/installations/create.ts`
- `services/backend/src/routes/mcp/installations/update.ts`
- `services/backend/src/routes/mcp/installations/delete.ts`
- `services/backend/src/routes/mcp/installations/updateArgs.ts`
- `services/backend/src/routes/mcp/installations/updateEnvironmentVars.ts`

### Satellite Integration

Satellites process commands through dedicated service components:

- **Command Polling**: Fetches and prioritizes commands
- **Dynamic Config Manager**: Handles configuration updates
- **HTTP Proxy Manager**: Manages proxy route changes
- **Remote Tool Discovery**: Discovers tools on new MCP servers

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times

- **Immediate Commands**: 2-3 second end-to-end response time
- **High Priority Commands**: 10-15 second response time
- **Normal Commands**: 30-60 second response time

### Scalability

- Commands scale horizontally across multiple satellites
- Global satellites receive broadcast commands automatically
- Team-specific satellites receive targeted commands only
- Command processing is asynchronous and non-blocking

### Reliability

- Commands include retry mechanisms with configurable limits
- Failed commands are logged with detailed error information
- Command expiration prevents indefinite retry loops
- Correlation IDs enable command tracking across system boundaries
