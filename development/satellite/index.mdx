# DeployStack Satellite Development

DeployStack Satellites are **edge workers** (similar to GitHub Actions runners) that manage MCP servers with enterprise-grade team isolation and security. This service represents DeployStack's strategic pivot from local CLI gateway to cloud-native MCP-as-a-Service platform.

## Current Implementation Status

:The satellite service has completed

- ✅ **Fastify HTTP Server** with Swagger API documentation
- ✅ **Pino Logging System** identical to backend configuration
- ✅ **MCP Transport Protocols** - SSE, SSE Messaging, Streamable HTTP
- ✅ **Session Management** with cryptographically secure session IDs
- ✅ **JSON-RPC 2.0 Protocol** compliance for MCP communication
- ✅ **TypeScript + Webpack** build system with full type safety
- ✅ **Development Workflow** with hot reload and linting
- ✅ **Backend Communication** (polling, commands, heartbeat with team-grouped processes)
- ✅ **Real-Time Event System** (immediate event emission with 3s batching, 10 event types)
- ✅ **OAuth 2.1 Authentication** (token introspection, team context)
- ✅ **stdio MCP Server Process Management** (spawn, monitor, auto-restart, terminate)
- ✅ **Team Isolation** (environment-based: nsjail in production, plain spawn in dev)
- ✅ **Auto-Restart Protection** (max 3 attempts, permanently_failed status)
- ✅ **Tool Discovery** (HTTP and stdio MCP servers)
- ✅ **Background Jobs System** (cron-like recurring tasks with automatic error handling)

## Architecture Vision

Satellites implement a hybrid edge worker pattern with five core internal components:

- **HTTP Proxy Router**: Team-aware request routing with OAuth 2.1 authentication
- **Dual MCP Server Manager**: Manages both external HTTP endpoints and stdio subprocess MCP servers
- **Team Resource Manager**: Linux namespaces, cgroups, and resource jailing (0.1 CPU, 100MB RAM per process)
- **Communication Manager**: Handles stdio JSON-RPC and HTTP proxy communication
- **Backend Communicator**: Integration with DeployStack Backend for configuration and monitoring

## Deployment Models (Planned)

Satellites will support two deployment patterns:

- **Global Satellites**: DeployStack-operated cloud infrastructure serving all teams with resource isolation
- **Team Satellites**: Customer-deployed within corporate networks for internal resource access
- **Dual MCP Server Support**: Both HTTP proxy (external endpoints) and stdio subprocess (local) MCP servers

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **HTTP Framework**: Fastify with native JSON Schema validation
- **Logging**: Pino logger with structured logging
- **MCP Transport**: SSE, Streamable HTTP, Direct HTTP protocols
- **Session Management**: Cryptographically secure 32-byte session IDs
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 Resource Server (planned)
- **Process Management**: stdio subprocess management (planned)
- **Team Isolation**: Linux namespaces and cgroups (planned)
- **Build System**: TypeScript + Webpack
- **Development**: Nodemon with hot reload

## Quick Start

## Development Patterns

### MCP Transport Development
Follow established patterns when working with MCP transport:

1. Use manual JSON serialization with `JSON.stringify()`
2. Implement comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
3. Include structured logging with operation tracking
4. Handle session management and activity tracking
5. Support both streaming and standard response modes

### API Route Development
Follow established patterns when adding new routes:

1. Create route files in `src/routes/` directories
2. Use reusable JSON Schema constants for validation
3. Implement TypeScript interfaces for type safety
4. Use manual JSON serialization with `JSON.stringify()`
5. Register routes in `src/routes/index.ts`

### Configuration Management
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Provide sensible defaults for development
- Document all configuration options
- Support both development and production modes

## Contributing

1. **Follow Backend Patterns**: Use identical logging, validation, and error handling
2. **Maintain Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for compile-time validation
3. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation for new features
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure changes work in both development and production
5. **Consider Enterprise**: Design features with team isolation and security in mind
