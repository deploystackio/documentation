# DeployStack Development

Welcome to the DeployStack development documentation! DeployStack eliminates MCP adoption friction by transforming complex installations into simple URL configurations through managed satellite infrastructure.

## Architecture Overview

DeployStack implements an MCP-as-a-Service architecture that eliminates installation friction:

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript web application (cloud.deploystack.io) for team management and configuration
- **Backend**: Fastify-based cloud control plane handling authentication, teams, and satellite coordination  
- **Satellite Infrastructure**: Managed MCP servers accessible via HTTPS URLs - no installation required
- **Shared**: Common utilities and TypeScript types used across all services
- **Dual Deployment**: Global satellites (DeployStack-managed) and team satellites (customer-deployed)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 8 or higher
- Git for version control
- DeployStack account at [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) (for satellite testing)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deploystackio/deploystack.git
cd deploystack

# Install dependencies for all services
cd services/frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
cd ../satellite && npm install

# Start development servers (in separate terminals)
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd services/backend && npm run dev  # http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd services/frontend && npm run dev  # http://localhost:5173

# Terminal 3 - Satellite (for local satellite testing)
cd services/satellite && npm run dev   # http://localhost:9095
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Choose Your Service**: Select frontend, backend, or satellite based on your contribution area
2. **Set Up Environment**: Follow the specific setup guides for your chosen service
3. **Understand Architecture**: Review how services interact (Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Satellite)
4. **Make Changes**: Implement features following established patterns (Vue SFC for frontend, plugins for backend, managed services for satellite)
5. **Test**: Run comprehensive test suites for your service
6. **Submit**: Create pull requests following our contribution guidelines

## Key Technologies

### Frontend Stack
- **Vue 3** with Composition API and Single File Components (SFC)
- **TypeScript** for type safety throughout the application
- **Vite** for fast HMR and optimized builds
- **TailwindCSS** with shadcn-vue component library
- **Direct fetch()** API calls (no axios or API client libraries)
- **Vue I18n** for multi-language support

### Backend Stack
- **Fastify** for high-performance cloud control plane
- **TypeScript** with full type safety
- **Drizzle ORM** supporting SQLite and PostgreSQL
- **Plugin System** with isolated routes (`/api/plugin/<id>/`)
- **Role-Based Access Control** with session management

### Satellite Stack
- **Node.js** edge worker runtime (like GitHub Actions runner)
- **HTTP Proxy + stdio Communication** for dual MCP server deployment (external HTTP endpoints and local subprocesses)
- **OAuth 2.1 Resource Server** with Backend token introspection
- **Team Isolation** using Linux namespaces, cgroups, and resource jailing
- **Dual Deployment Model** global satellites (DeployStack-managed) and team satellites (customer-deployed)
- **Process Management** with automatic cleanup, selective restart, and lifecycle management

## Development Philosophy

### MCP-as-a-Service Platform
DeployStack provides managed MCP infrastructure through:

- **Zero Installation Friction**: Transform complex MCP setup into simple URL configuration
- **Managed Satellite Infrastructure**: Global satellites and enterprise team satellites
- **Enterprise Progression**: Freemium satellites → paid tiers → team satellites
- **Universal Compatibility**: Supports MCP servers in any language via managed infrastructure

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout the stack
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear, up-to-date documentation
- **Security**: Built-in security best practices
