# MCP User Configuration and Personal Settings

Individual users customize personal MCP settings within boundaries set by their team administrators. You configure only the settings made available to you, focusing on personal productivity while automatically inheriting secure team credentials and standards.

## Overview

As a user, you personalize your MCP server experience within team-defined boundaries:

- **Personal Settings** that adapt to your individual workflow
- **Automatic Team Integration** with shared credentials and team standards
- **Simplified Interface** showing only settings you can modify
- **Secure Experience** without credential management burden

The user tier builds on team configurations, which build on global schemas. For an overview of the complete system, see [MCP Configuration System](/mcp-configuration).

## Configuration Boundaries

Your configuration options are precisely determined by how global administrators categorized elements during schema creation and your team administrator's lock/unlock decisions:

**ðŸ”“ You Can Configure:**
- **Unlocked Elements** - Settings your team admin made available for personal customization
- **User-Specific Elements** - Settings designed for individual workflow (like local file paths)

**ðŸ”’ You Cannot See or Modify:**
- **Locked Team Settings** - Shared configuration controlled by team administrators
- **Hidden Credentials** - API keys and secrets managed securely by your team
- **Template Elements** - System-level parameters locked by global administrators

**ðŸ”— You Automatically Inherit:**
- **Team Credentials** - API keys and authentication tokens
- **Team Standards** - Shared settings and organizational preferences
- **Template Configuration** - System-level parameters locked by global administrators

For details on how global administrators define these boundaries and team administrators control access, see [Admin Schema Workflow](/mcp-admin-schema-workflow) and [Team Installation](/mcp-team-installation).

## User Interface Experience

When you configure an MCP server, you see a clean interface focused only on your personal options:

```
Personal Configuration: "Team Web Search"

YOUR PERSONAL SETTINGS

Search Preferences:
â”œâ”€ Default Search Engine: Google â–¼
â”œâ”€ Results Per Page: 10 â–¼  
â””â”€ Safe Search: Moderate â–¼

Cache Settings:
â”œâ”€ Enable Result Caching: âœ“
â””â”€ Cache Duration: 1 hour â–¼

TEAM-MANAGED SETTINGS (You inherit these automatically)

âœ“ Team API credentials: â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ (encrypted, see Security)
âœ“ Shared search quotas: 1000 queries/day
âœ“ Team content filters: Enabled

```

**Key Interface Features:**
- **Only Personal Options** - You see only settings you can modify
- **Clear Inheritance** - Understanding of what you get from your team
- **Validation** - Immediate feedback on configuration validity

## Personal Configuration Types

### User Arguments

Most commonly, you'll configure:

**API Preferences:**
- Search result limits and pagination
- Content filtering and safety settings
- Cache and performance preferences

### User Environment Variables

**Personal Preferences:**
- Search engine preferences and result formatting
- Cache settings and performance tuning
- Interface customization options

## Configuration Process

When you first configure an MCP server:

1. **Access Team Installation** - Navigate to your team's MCP server installations
2. **Select Server** - Choose the server you want to configure personally
3. **Personal Configuration** - Configure only the unlocked elements
4. **Validation** - System validates your configuration against team schema
5. **Save and Deploy** - Personal configuration is saved and ready to use

## Configuration Assembly

Your final MCP server configuration combines settings from all three tiers:

```
Final Configuration = Template + Team + Your Personal Settings

Template (System):
â”œâ”€ Command: "npx"
â”œâ”€ Package: "@brightdata/mcp-server-web-search"
â””â”€ System flags: "-y"

+ Team (Shared):
â”œâ”€ Team API Key: "â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ (encrypted secret, hidden from you)"
â”œâ”€ Search quota: "1000 queries/day"
â””â”€ Content filters: "enabled"

+ Your Personal Settings:
â”œâ”€ Default search engine: "google"
â”œâ”€ Results per page: 10
â””â”€ Cache duration: "1 hour"

= Final Runtime Configuration:
Command: npx -y @brightdata/mcp-server-web-search
Environment: {
  "TEAM_API_KEY": "decrypted-for-runtime-only",
  "SEARCH_QUOTA": "1000", 
  "CONTENT_FILTERS": "enabled",
  "DEFAULT_ENGINE": "google",
  "RESULTS_PER_PAGE": "10",
  "CACHE_DURATION": "3600"
}
```

**Automatic Validation:**
- Your settings are validated against the schema
- Type checking ensures correct data formats
- Invalid search preferences are caught before saving
- Missing required fields are highlighted
