description: Complete architectural overview of DeployStack's Control Plane / Data Plane system for enterprise MCP management
---




DeployStack transforms MCP from individual developer tools into enterprise-ready infrastructure through a sophisticated **Control Plane / Satellite architecture**. Our platform eliminates installation friction, provides secure credential management, and offers complete organizational visibility for teams of any size.

## The Problem: MCP Without Management

  />
</div>

Traditional MCP implementation creates significant organizational challenges:

### Configuration Hell
- **Manual Setup**: Developers spend hours configuring each MCP server with complex JSON files
- **Environment Variables**: API keys and tokens scattered across local `.env` files and shell configurations
- **Inconsistent Environments**: "Works on my machine" problems due to configuration drift across team members

### Security & Compliance Gaps
- **Credential Sprawl**: API keys shared via Slack, email, or committed to version control
- **Zero Visibility**: Organizations have no insight into which MCP tools are being used or by whom
- **No Access Control**: Anyone can run any MCP server locally without oversight

### Operational Chaos
- **Onboarding Friction**: New team members need days to set up all required MCP tools
- **Tool Discovery**: Developers waste time finding and configuring tools individually
- **No Standardization**: No central catalog or approved tool list for organizational use

## The Solution: MCP-as-a-Service

DeployStack introduces a **Control Plane / Satellite architecture** that brings enterprise-grade management to the MCP ecosystem with zero installation friction through managed satellite infrastructure.

### Control Plane: cloud.deploystack.io

The cloud-based control plane provides centralized management for all MCP infrastructure:

#### Team & Access Management
- **Role-Based Access Control**: [Define teams](/teams), [roles, and permissions](/roles) for MCP server access
- **Centralized User Management**: Single source of truth for team membership and access rights
- **Policy Enforcement**: Granular control over which teams can access which MCP servers

#### Secure Credential Vault
- **Encrypted Storage**: All API keys and tokens stored with [enterprise-grade encryption](/security)
- **Zero-Exposure Model**: Developers never directly handle credentials

#### MCP Server Catalog
- **Configuration Management**: [Store and manage all MCP server configurations](/mcp-catalog) including commands, arguments, and environment variables
- **Version Control**: Track changes to MCP server configurations over time (coming soon)

#### Analytics & Governance (Coming soon)
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which developers use which MCP servers and how frequently
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor expensive API usage across teams and optimize spending
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all MCP server interactions for compliance

### Satellite Infrastructure: Global & Team Satellites

The satellite infrastructure provides managed MCP services through two deployment models:

#### Global Satellites (Managed by DeployStack)
- **Zero Installation**: Access via simple HTTPS URL configuration
- **Auto-Scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Multi-Region**: Low-latency global availability
- **Fully Featured**: Complete MCP server access and team management

#### Team Satellites (Customer-Deployed)
- **On-Premise Deployment**: Within corporate networks for internal resource access
- **Complete Team Isolation**: Linux namespaces and cgroups for security
- **Internal Resources**: Connect to company databases, APIs, file systems
- **Enterprise Security**: Full compliance and governance controls

#### OAuth Authentication
- **Standard OAuth Flow**: Client credentials generated in dashboard
- **Secure Token Exchange**: Standard Bearer Token authentication
- **Team-Aware Access**: Credentials scoped to specific teams and permissions
- **Zero Credential Storage**: No local credential management required

## Protocol Flow

### 1. OAuth Client Setup
- Developer creates OAuth client credentials in cloud.deploystack.io dashboard
- Client ID and Secret generated for secure satellite access
- No software installation or local authentication required

### 2. VS Code Configuration
**Simple URL Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deploystack": {
      "url": "https://satellite.deploystack.io/mcp",
      "oauth": {
        "client_id": "deploystack_mcp_client_abc123def456ghi789",
        "client_secret": "deploystack_mcp_secret_xyz789abc123def456ghi789jkl012"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Satellite Connection
**Connection Flow**:
1. **OAuth Authentication**: Client credentials validated against control plane
2. **Team Resolution**: User's team memberships and permissions retrieved
3. **Tool Discovery**: Available MCP tools based on team configuration
4. **Request Processing**: All tool requests processed through managed satellite infrastructure

### 4. Request Processing
```
Client Request → OAuth Validation → Team Authorization → Satellite MCP Processing → Response
```

## Security Architecture

DeployStack implements enterprise-grade security across all components of the platform. For comprehensive security details including credential management, access control, and compliance features, see our [Security Documentation](/security).

Key security principles:
- **OAuth Bearer Token Authentication**: Standard OAuth flow with secure credential management
- **Team Isolation**: Complete separation between team resources and data
- **Managed Infrastructure**: Enterprise-grade security controls in satellite infrastructure

## Performance Optimization

### Managed Satellite Infrastructure
Unlike local installations, DeployStack uses managed satellite infrastructure:

- **Instant Availability**: All tools immediately available without local setup
- **Auto-Scaling**: Satellite infrastructure scales automatically with demand
- **Global Distribution**: Multiple regions for low-latency access worldwide
- **Zero Maintenance**: No local processes to manage or update

### Caching Strategy
DeployStack implements sophisticated caching mechanisms in satellite infrastructure for optimal performance. Caching is managed transparently by the satellite infrastructure with no local configuration required.

1. Register at cloud.deploystack.io
2. Create OAuth client credentials
3. Add URL to VS Code configuration
4. # Done! All authorized tools available immediately
```

**VS Code Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
