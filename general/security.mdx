DeployStack takes security seriously. This guide explains how we protect your information and what you can do to keep your account and deployments secure.

## Your Account Security

### Secure Passwords
DeployStack uses industry-standard security practices to protect your password:

- **Never stored in plain text**: Your password is encrypted using advanced security methods
- **Unique protection**: Each password gets its own unique security key
- **Computational protection**: Even if someone accessed our database, your password would be extremely difficult to decrypt

**What this means for you**: Your password is safe, but you should still choose a strong, unique password.

### Login Sessions
When you log into DeployStack:

- **Secure cookies**: Your login is stored in a secure cookie that websites can't access
- **Automatic expiration**: Sessions automatically expire after 30 days for security
- **HTTPS protection**: All login information is encrypted when traveling over the internet
- **Safe logout**: Logging out immediately invalidates your session

**What this means for you**: You can trust that your login sessions are secure and protected.

### Email Verification
To ensure account security:

- **Verification required**: New accounts must verify their email address
- **Secure tokens**: Verification links contain secure, time-limited tokens
- **24-hour expiration**: Verification links expire after 24 hours
- **One-time use**: Each verification link can only be used once
- **Administrator exception**: The first user (administrator) is automatically verified

**What this means for you**: Only you can activate your account, and verification links are secure and temporary.

## Data Protection

### MCP Configuration Security

DeployStack automatically protects sensitive MCP configuration values through a selective encryption system:

**Secret Type Implementation:**
- **Schema-Based Detection**: Fields marked as `type: "secret"` in MCP schemas are automatically identified for encryption
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Secret values are encrypted using the same industry-standard encryption as global settings
- **Selective Processing**: Only secret-type fields are encrypted; regular configuration values remain as plaintext for performance
- **Encrypted Storage**: Secret values are stored encrypted in the database and never saved as plaintext

**API Response Protection:**
- **Automatic Masking**: All API responses automatically mask secret values as `*****`
- **No Secret Exposure**: Secret values never appear in API responses, logs, or user interfaces
- **Runtime Decryption**: Only authorized operations (like satellite configuration generation) can decrypt secrets for actual use

**Three-Tier Secret Management:**
- **Template Level**: Global administrators define which fields are secret types in schemas
- **Team Level**: Team administrators configure secret values (API keys, tokens) that all team members inherit
- **User Level**: Users see masked values (`*****`) and cannot access actual secret content

**What Gets Encrypted:**
- API keys and authentication tokens
- Database passwords and connection strings
- Service credentials and access keys
- Any configuration field marked as `type: "secret"` in the schema

**What Doesn't Get Encrypted:**
- Debug flags and boolean settings
- File paths and directory names
- Public configuration values
- Regular string, number, and boolean fields

**Security Benefits:**
- **Zero Secret Exposure**: Impossible for secrets to leak through API responses
- **Database Protection**: Even database access doesn't reveal plaintext secrets
- **Audit Safe**: Logs and interfaces never contain actual secret values
- **Team Security**: Team members use secrets without seeing actual values

### Global Settings Encryption
Your global configuration data is protected with encryption:

- **Encrypted storage**: Sensitive settings like passwords and API keys are encrypted
- **Secure keys**: Encryption uses industry-standard methods
- **Protected access**: Only authorized users can view or modify settings

**What this means for you**: Your SMTP passwords, API keys, and other sensitive configuration data is securely encrypted.

### Database Security
All data is protected through:

- **Input validation**: Everything you enter is checked for security before being saved
- **SQL injection protection**: Database queries are automatically secured
- **Proper access controls**: Users can only access data they're authorized to see

**What this means for you**: Your data is protected from common security attacks.

## Account Access Control

### User Roles
DeployStack uses role-based access to keep your installation secure:

- **Administrator access**: Only administrators can manage users and system settings
- **User isolation**: Regular users can only access their own teams and projects
- **Permission checking**: Every action is checked against your current permissions

**What this means for you**: Users only have access to features and data appropriate for their role.

### Team Security
Your teams and projects are protected:

- **Team ownership**: Only team owners can modify team settings
- **Member control**: Team access is controlled by the team owner
- **Isolated data**: Teams cannot access each other's information

**What this means for you**: Your team data is private and secure from other users.
