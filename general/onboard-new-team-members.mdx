# Onboard New Team Members

This guide walks you through adding new developers to your existing DeployStack team. Before starting, ensure you already have:

- A configured team with MCP servers set up
- Team Administrator privileges
- The new member's email address

## Prerequisites

Before inviting team members, make sure:

- You have Team Administrator or Team Owner privileges
- Your team MCP servers are properly configured and tested
- You're not trying to add members to your default team (personal teams don't support additional members)

## Step 1: New Member Account Setup

The new team member needs to complete these steps first:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create DeployStack Account**
    
    Go to [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) and create a new account:
    
    - Sign up with their email address
    - Complete email verification if required
    - Complete the initial account setup
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Invite Team Member

### Add Member to Your Team

1. **Navigate to Teams**: Go to your DeployStack dashboard and click on "Teams"
2. **Select Your Team**: Find the team you want to add members to and click "Manage"
3. **Add New Member**: Click "Add Member" and enter the new member's email address

## Step 3: Complete Team Setup

After the team invitation is accepted, the new member needs to:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Accept Team Invitation**
    
    The new member should:
    
    - Check their DeployStack dashboard for the team invitation
    - Accept the invitation to join the team
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Create OAuth Credentials**
    
    Configure satellite access for the team:
    
    1. Navigate to the **Satellite** section in the dashboard
    2. Select the appropriate team from the team selector
    3. Click **Create MCP Client Credentials**
    4. Enter a name for the client (e.g., "VS Code", "Claude Desktop")
    5. Copy the generated OAuth credentials:
       - **Client ID**: `deploystack_mcp_client_abc123def456ghi789`
       - **Client Secret**: `deploystack_mcp_secret_xyz789abc123def456ghi789jkl012`
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Update MCP Configuration**
    
    Replace your VS Code MCP configuration with the DeployStack Satellite:
    
    **Before (Individual MCP Servers):**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "brightdata": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
          "env": {
            "API_TOKEN": "user-managed-token"
          }
        },
        "github": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["@github/mcp"],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_TOKEN": "user-managed-token"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **After (DeployStack Satellite):**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "deploystack": {
          "url": "https://satellite.deploystack.io/mcp",
          "name": "DeployStack Satellite",
          "description": "MCP-as-a-Service with zero installation"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Verify Team Access

### Test MCP Tool Access

1. **Restart VS Code**: Restart VS Code to load the new satellite configuration
2. **Test MCP Connection**: Use Claude or MCP-compatible tools to verify access
3. **Verify Available Tools**: All team MCP tools should be instantly available
4. **Test Functionality**: Confirm tools work without any manual credential setup

## Step 5: Test Team Access

### Verify Team MCP Servers

1. **Open VS Code**: Launch VS Code or restart if already open
2. **Test MCP Connection**: Use Claude or MCP-compatible tools to verify access
3. **Check Available Tools**: Confirm all team MCP servers are accessible
4. **Test Credentials**: Verify that API calls work without manual credential setup

### Confirm Team Resources

- **Team MCP Servers**: Access to all configured team servers
- **Shared Credentials**: Automatic credential injection (no manual setup required)
- **Team Environment Variables**: Access to team-wide environment settings
- **Instant Access**: All tools immediately available through satellite infrastructure

## Step 6: Team Orientation

### Brief New Members On

**Available MCP Servers:**
- Which servers are configured for the team
- What each server is used for
- Any usage guidelines or best practices

**Team Workflows:**
- How the team uses MCP tools in development
- Any specific processes or conventions
- Who to contact for technical support

**Security Guidelines:**
- Never manually manage API credentials (handled by DeployStack)
- Always use the DeployStack Satellite for MCP access
- Report any authentication or access issues immediately
- Keep OAuth client credentials secure (don't share or commit to version control)

## Next Steps

Once new team members are successfully onboarded:

- **Share Team Documentation**: Provide any team-specific MCP usage guides
- **Schedule Training**: Consider hands-on training for complex MCP workflows
- **Gather Feedback**: Collect feedback on the onboarding process for improvements

New team members should now have secure, credential-free access to all team MCP servers through the DeployStack Satellite, enabling them to be productive immediately without any installations or complex credential management.
