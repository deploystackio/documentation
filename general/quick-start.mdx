title: Quick Start
description: Start using MCP tools in under 1 minute with DeployStack - no installation, no configuration files, just connect and go.
---

# Quick Start

Get your first MCP tools running in under 1 minute. We've eliminated the installation friction that holds back MCP adoption - just create an account, click a button, and connect. Your account comes with a pre-installed MCP server ready to test immediately.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- A DeployStack account with one pre-installed MCP server
- Your MCP client (VS Code, Cursor, or Claude Desktop) connected to DeployStack Satellite
- Working MCP tools accessible through your client
- Understanding of how to add more MCP servers

**Time Required:** Under 1 minute (not counting account creation)

## Prerequisites

You need just two things:

- **An MCP Client**: VS Code, Cursor IDE, or Claude Desktop
- **A Web Browser**: For OAuth authorization
- **That's it**: No installations, no CLI tools, no configuration file editing

## The 3-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Visit [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) and create your free account.
    
    You can sign up with:
    - Email address
    - GitHub account
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Explore Your Dashboard">
    Once logged in, you'll see your dashboard with:
    - One pre-installed MCP server ready to use
    - "Get Client Configuration" button in the top-right corner
    - Empty team space ready for collaboration
    
    We pre-install a demo MCP server so you can test the platform immediately without adding anything first.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Connect Your MCP Client

Now connect your MCP client to DeployStack Satellite. This is where the "zero installation" comes in - no CLI tools to install, no npm packages to manage, just click and connect.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Configuration">
    In your DeployStack dashboard:
    
    1. Click the **"Get Client Configuration"** button (top-right corner)
    2. A modal opens showing supported MCP clients
    3. Select your client from the dropdown:
       - VS Code
       - Cursor IDE
       - Claude Desktop
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install or Copy Configuration">
    Depending on your client, you'll see one of two options:
    
    **For Cursor IDE:**
    - Click the **"Install in Cursor"** button
    - Cursor opens automatically with configuration applied
    - Done! Skip to Step 3
    
    **For VS Code or Claude Desktop:**
    - Copy the JSON configuration shown in the modal
    - Open your MCP client settings
    - Paste the configuration
    - Save the settings file
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **What Just Happened?**
  
  You added the DeployStack Satellite URL to your MCP client. Instead of running MCP servers locally, your client now connects to our managed infrastructure where your MCP servers run securely with your team's credentials.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Authorize the Connection

The final step happens automatically when you connect - DeployStack uses OAuth2.1 for secure, credential-free authorization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Connection">
    In your MCP client:
    - Click **"Connect"** or **"Start"** next to the DeployStack Satellite entry
    - Your web browser opens automatically
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Team and Authorize">
    In the browser window:
    1. You'll see your available teams
    2. Select the team you want to use
    3. Click **"Authorize"**
    4. Browser window closes automatically
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connected!">
    Back in your MCP client:
    - Connection status shows "Connected"
    - Your pre-installed MCP server is now available
    - You can start using MCP tools immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify It Works

Let's make sure your MCP connection is working by testing your pre-installed server.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your MCP Client">
    In VS Code, Cursor, or Claude Desktop, open the MCP tools panel or command palette.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Available Tools">
    You should see tools from your pre-installed MCP server listed.
    
    Try running one of the available tools to confirm everything works.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View in Dashboard">
    Go back to [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) and check:
    - Your dashboard shows connection activity
    - You can see which MCP server is active
    - Usage analytics start appearing
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
  **ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!**
  
  You now have a working MCP connection through DeployStack Satellite. Your pre-installed MCP server is running on managed infrastructure, and you can add more servers anytime from the catalog.
</Callout>

## What's Next?

### Add More MCP Servers

Your account comes with one pre-installed server, but DeployStack offers access to hundreds of MCP servers from the official registry:

1. **Browse the Catalog**: Visit the [MCP Server](https://cloud.deploystack.io/) in your dashboard
2. **Choose Servers**: Browse by category or search for specific tools
3. **Add to Team**: Click "Add to Team" on any server
4. **Configure Credentials**: Add required credentials (API keys, tokens, etc.)
5. **Instant Access**: Server appears in your MCP client immediately

For more details, see the [MCP Server Catalog Guide](/general/mcp-catalog).

### Invite Team Members

DeployStack is built for team collaboration:

1. **Navigate to Team Settings**: Go to your team page
2. **Click "Invite Members"**: Enter email addresses
3. **Set Roles**: Choose appropriate permissions
4. **Send Invitations**: Team members receive email invitations
5. **Instant Sharing**: Once they accept, they get access to all team MCP servers

## Working with Multiple Teams

If you're part of multiple teams or create additional teams:

1. **Switch Teams in Dashboard**: Use the team selector at [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io)
2. **Disconnect in MCP Client**: Disconnect from DeployStack Satellite
3. **Reconnect**: Click "Connect" again
4. **Choose Different Team**: In the OAuth browser window, select the new team
5. **Authorize**: Your MCP client now uses the new team's servers

**Each team has:**
- Separate MCP server configurations
- Independent credentials and API keys
- Isolated usage and analytics
- Team-specific access control
