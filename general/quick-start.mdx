# Quick Start

Get started with DeployStack in minutes. This guide walks you through creating a free account, configuring your first MCP server, and connecting your development environment with zero installation.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- A free DeployStack account with team management
- Your first MCP server configured with secure credentials
- Instant access to MCP tools via satellite URL
- VS Code connected to your team's MCP tools

## Prerequisites

- **VS Code or Cursor**: For MCP tool integration
- **A few minutes**: This entire setup takes less than 3 minutes
- **No installations required**: Zero local dependencies

## Step 1: Create Your Free Account

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Sign Up for DeployStack**
    
    Visit [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) and create your free account:
    
    - Sign up with your email address or GitHub account
    - Complete email verification if required
    - You'll automatically get your own default team
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Explore Your Dashboard**
    
    Once logged in, you'll see preinstalled MCP servers in your dashboard.
    We have preinstalled popular MCP servers like Sequential Thinking. You can add more whenever you want to.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Get Your OAuth Credentials

DeployStack Satellite provides instant MCP access through managed infrastructure - no installation required.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create OAuth Client Credentials**
    
    In your DeployStack dashboard:
    
    1. Navigate to the **Satellite** section
    2. Click **Create MCP Client Credentials**
    3. Enter a name for your client (e.g., "VS Code", "Claude Desktop")
    4. Copy the generated OAuth credentials:
       - **Client ID**: `deploystack_mcp_client_abc123def456ghi789`
       - **Client Secret**: `deploystack_mcp_secret_xyz789abc123def456ghi789jkl012`
    
    These OAuth credentials provide secure access to your team's MCP servers through standard OAuth Bearer Token authentication.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Connect Your Development Environment

Now connect VS Code or Cursor to use your team's MCP servers via satellite.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Configure VS Code MCP Settings**
    
    Open your VS Code settings and configure MCP to use the DeployStack Satellite.
    
    **Location**: `.vscode/settings.json` or global VS Code settings
    
    **Before** (manual MCP server management):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["@github/mcp"],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **After** (DeployStack Satellite):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "deploystack": {
          "url": "https://satellite.deploystack.io/mcp",
          "oauth": {
            "client_id": "deploystack_mcp_client_abc123def456ghi789",
            "client_secret": "deploystack_mcp_secret_xyz789abc123def456ghi789jkl012"
          },
          "name": "DeployStack Satellite",
          "description": "MCP-as-a-Service with zero installation"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Test MCP Connection**
    
    1. **Restart VS Code** to load the new MCP configuration
    2. **Open Claude or compatible MCP client**
    3. **Test a tool**: Try using one of your configured MCP servers
    4. **Verify**: Tools should work instantly without any local setup
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Explore Your Setup

Now that everything is connected, explore what you can do:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Test Available Tools**
    
    In your VS Code MCP client:
    - All configured MCP tools are instantly available
    - No local processes or installations required
    - Tools automatically include your team's credentials
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Monitor Usage**
    
    View activity in your [DeployStack dashboard](https://cloud.deploystack.io):
    - Real-time MCP tool usage
    - Team activity and analytics
    - Satellite performance metrics
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Manage Your Team**
    
    Back in the [DeployStack dashboard](https://cloud.deploystack.io):
    - Add more MCP servers to your team
    - Manage credentials securely
    - Monitor satellite usage
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Satellite Connection

With DeployStack Satellite, management is done through the web dashboard:

- **Configuration**: All changes made in [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io)
- **Instant Updates**: Changes take effect immediately, no local updates needed
- **Team Switching**: Change teams in the dashboard, regenerate token if needed
- **Monitoring**: View real-time usage and performance metrics
- **Zero Maintenance**: No local processes to start, stop, or restart

## Multiple Teams

If you're part of multiple teams or create additional teams:

1. **Switch Teams**: Use the team selector in your [DeployStack dashboard](https://cloud.deploystack.io)
2. **Generate New OAuth Credentials**: Each team requires separate OAuth client credentials for security
3. **Update VS Code**: Replace the oauth client_id and client_secret with the new team's credentials
4. **Instant Access**: New team's MCP tools are immediately available

When you switch teams:
- New team's MCP servers become available instantly
- Previous team's tools are no longer accessible (security isolation)
- All team-specific credentials are automatically applied

## What's Next?

### Add More MCP Servers

Expand your toolkit by adding more MCP servers:
- **BrightData**: Web scraping and data collection
- **Weather**: Weather information and forecasts
- **Database**: Connect to your databases
- **Custom Servers**: Add your own private MCP servers

### Team Collaboration

If you're working with a team:
- **[Invite Team Members](/onboard-new-team-members)**: Add developers to your team
- **[Manage Roles](/roles)**: Set up proper access control
- **[Team Management](/teams)**: Organize multiple projects

## Troubleshooting

### Satellite Connection Issues

1. **Check OAuth credentials**:
   - Verify your client_id and client_secret are correct
   - Regenerate OAuth credentials in dashboard if needed

2. **Verify VS Code configuration**:
   - Ensure the satellite URL is `https://satellite.deploystack.io/mcp`
   - Check oauth section has your current client_id and client_secret
   - Restart VS Code after configuration changes

3. **Test connection**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://satellite.deploystack.io/mcp \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN" \
        -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
   ```

### MCP Tools Not Working

1. **Check satellite status**: Visit your [dashboard](https://cloud.deploystack.io) for real-time status
2. **Verify credentials**: Ensure OAuth credentials are properly configured for your team
3. **Client permissions**: Confirm your OAuth client has access to the required MCP servers
