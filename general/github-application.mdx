# GitHub Application Integration

DeployStack provides seamless GitHub integration that automatically extracts repository information when creating MCP servers. This integration works in two modes to accommodate both local development and production environments.

## How GitHub Integration Works

### MCP Server Creation Process

When you create an MCP server in DeployStack and provide a GitHub repository URL, the system automatically:

1. **Fetches Repository Metadata**: Extracts the repository name, description, primary programming language, license information, and topics
2. **Analyzes Technical Details**: Determines the appropriate runtime environment (Node.js for TypeScript/JavaScript, Python for Python projects, etc.)
3. **Reads Package Information**: Scans package.json, pyproject.toml, or other package files to understand dependencies and installation requirements
4. **Generates Installation Methods**: Creates appropriate installation commands based on the detected package manager and project type
5. **Auto-populates Form Fields**: Pre-fills the MCP server creation form with all discovered information

This automation saves significant time and ensures consistency when adding MCP servers from GitHub repositories.

### Smart Runtime Detection

DeployStack intelligently maps programming languages to their corresponding runtime environments:

- **TypeScript/JavaScript** → Node.js runtime
- **Python** → Python runtime  
- **Go** → Go runtime
- **Rust** → Rust runtime
- **Java** → Java runtime
- **C#** → .NET runtime

The system also detects minimum runtime versions from package files when available.

## Two Authentication Modes

DeployStack supports two GitHub integration modes to accommodate different use cases:

### Local/Development Mode (No GitHub App Required)

**When to use**: Perfect for local development, personal projects, and working with public repositories.

**How it works**:
- Uses GitHub's public API without authentication
- Works immediately without any setup
- Accesses public repositories only
- Subject to GitHub's unauthenticated rate limits (60 requests per hour per IP address)

**Benefits**:
- Zero configuration required
- Works out of the box
- Ideal for open-source MCP servers
- Perfect for local development and testing

**Limitations**:
- Public repositories only
- Lower rate limits
- Cannot access private repositories
- May hit rate limits with heavy usage

### Production/Enterprise Mode (GitHub App Required)

**When to use**: Production environments, private repositories, high-volume usage, or enterprise deployments.

**How it works**:
- Uses GitHub App authentication with higher privileges
- Requires GitHub App creation and configuration
- Can access both public and private repositories
- Higher rate limits (5,000 requests per hour)

**Benefits**:
- Access to private repositories
- Higher rate limits for production use
- Better for team environments
- More reliable for continuous integration

**Requirements**:
- GitHub App must be created
- App credentials must be configured in DeployStack
- App must be installed on target repositories

## Automatic Mode Selection

DeployStack automatically chooses the appropriate authentication mode based on your configuration:

- **GitHub App Disabled** (default): Uses public API mode for immediate functionality
- **GitHub App Enabled**: Uses authenticated mode for enhanced capabilities

You can switch between modes at any time through the Global Settings without affecting existing MCP servers.

## Setting Up GitHub App (Optional)

If you need access to private repositories or higher rate limits, you can optionally configure a GitHub App:

### Step 1: Create GitHub App

1. **Navigate to GitHub**: Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps
2. **Create New App**: Click "New GitHub App"
3. **Configure Basic Information**:
   - **App Name**: `DeployStack - [Your Organization]`
   - **Homepage URL**: Your DeployStack instance URL
   - **Webhook URL**: Not required for this integration
   - **Repository permissions**: 
     - Contents: Read (to access repository files)
     - Metadata: Read (to access repository information)
     - Pull requests: Read (optional, for future features)

### Step 2: Generate Credentials

1. **Note the App ID**: Copy the numeric App ID from the app settings
2. **Generate Private Key**: Click "Generate a private key" and download the .pem file
3. **Install the App**: Install the app on your organization or specific repositories

### Step 3: Configure DeployStack

1. **Access Global Settings**: Navigate to Admin → Global Settings → GitHub App Configuration
2. **Enter Credentials**:
   - **App ID**: The numeric ID from step 2
   - **Private Key**: Upload or paste the contents of the .pem file (will be automatically base64 encoded)
   - **Installation ID**: Found in the app installation URL
3. **Enable Integration**: Toggle "Enable GitHub App integration"
4. **Test Connection**: Use the built-in connection test to verify setup

### Step 4: Verify Setup

1. **Test with Private Repository**: Try creating an MCP server from a private repository
2. **Check Rate Limits**: Monitor usage in the GitHub App settings
3. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure the app has access to required repositories

## Repository Information Extracted

When processing a GitHub repository, DeployStack extracts:

### Basic Information
- Repository name and description
- Primary programming language
- License type (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.)
- Homepage URL
- Repository topics/tags

### Technical Details
- Runtime environment and version requirements
- Package dependencies and their versions
- Installation and build scripts
- Project structure and entry points

### Metadata
- Repository statistics (stars, forks)
- Latest release information
- Default branch name
- Repository owner and organization

### Installation Methods
- Package manager commands (npm, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Git clone instructions
- Build and setup procedures
- Environment variable requirements
