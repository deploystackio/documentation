MCP categories are simple organizational labels that help you find the right MCP servers in the catalog. Think of them like folders or tags that group similar servers together.

## What are MCP Categories?

Categories are just labels that organize MCP servers by their purpose or functionality. For example:

- **Development Tools** - Code analysis, Git integration, CI/CD tools
- **Data Sources** - Database connectors, API integrations, file systems  
- **AI & ML** - Machine learning models, AI services, data processing
- **Communication** - Chat platforms, email services, notification systems
- **Productivity** - Task management, calendars, document processing

When you browse the MCP catalog, you can filter by category to quickly find servers that match what you're looking for, instead of scrolling through everything.

## Who Can Manage Categories?

Only Global Administrators can create, edit, or delete categories. Regular users can view and use categories to filter servers, but cannot modify the category system itself.

## How Categories Work

When someone adds an MCP server to the catalog, they assign it to a category. This makes it easier for everyone to discover relevant servers. Categories are shared across the entire platform - both global servers and team servers use the same category system.

That's it! Categories are simply an organizational tool to make finding MCP servers easier.
