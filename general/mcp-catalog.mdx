title: MCP Server Catalog
description: Discover, manage, and deploy Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers through DeployStack's comprehensive catalog system.
---


The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Catalog is DeployStack's comprehensive system for discovering, managing, and deploying MCP servers. It provides a centralized repository where you can find pre-configured MCP servers, contribute your own, and manage deployments across your teams.

## What is the MCP Catalog?

The MCP Catalog serves as a marketplace and management system for MCP servers, offering:

- **Server Discovery**: Browse available MCP servers by category, language, and functionality
- **Official Registry Integration**: Automatic synchronization with the official MCP Registry at registry.modelcontextprotocol.io
- **Team-Based Management**: Organize servers within your teams with proper access control
- **Version Management**: Track different versions of MCP servers with changelog support
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic synchronization with GitHub repositories
- **Global and Team Servers**: Support for both community-wide and team-specific servers

## Catalog Structure

### Server Visibility Levels

The catalog supports two types of servers:

#### Global Servers
- **Visibility**: Available to all users across the platform
- **Management**: Only Global Administrators can create, edit, and delete
- **Purpose**: Community-contributed servers, official integrations, popular tools
- **Examples**: Official OpenAI MCP server, popular GitHub integrations, common utilities

#### Team Servers
- **Visibility**: Only visible to team members
- **Management**: Team administrators can create, edit, and delete within their teams
- **Purpose**: Custom integrations, private tools, team-specific configurations
- **Examples**: Internal API integrations, custom business logic, proprietary tools

### Server Sources

The catalog contains servers from two sources:

#### Official Registry Servers
- **Source**: Synced automatically from registry.modelcontextprotocol.io
- **Identification**: Marked with `synced_from_official_registry` flag
- **Updates**: Periodically refreshed via background jobs
- **Enhanced Data**: Enriched with GitHub metadata (stars, README, topics)
- **Official Name**: Stored in reverse-DNS format (e.g., "io.github.upstash/context7")

#### Manual Servers
- **Source**: Created manually by administrators
- **Purpose**: Custom integrations not in official registry
- **Flexibility**: Full control over all server properties
- **Team Servers**: Can be created by team administrators

#### GitHub-Deployed Servers
- **Source**: Deployed directly from GitHub repositories by teams
- **Identification**: Marked with `source='github'` in the database
- **Deployment**: Team admins deploy their own MCP servers via the `/deploy` endpoint
- **Transport Type**: Always STDIO (HTTP/SSE deployments not supported)
- **Visibility**: Team-scoped servers (`visibility='team'`, `owner_team_id` set)
- **Management**: Fully managed by the deploying team

Team administrators can deploy MCP servers directly from their GitHub repositories, providing a self-serve deployment experience. These servers are automatically configured with the latest commit SHA and can be updated through GitHub webhooks. For complete details on deploying MCP servers from GitHub, see the GitHub Deployment documentation.

### Categories

Servers are organized into categories for easy discovery and filtering. Categories are simple organizational labels that group servers by their purpose or functionality.

For a complete explanation of how MCP categories work, see the [MCP Categories Guide](/general/mcp-categories).

**Note**: Only Global Administrators can create and manage categories.

## User Permissions

Access to the MCP catalog is controlled by your role and team membership:

### Permission Matrix

| Role | Global Servers | Team Servers | Can Create | Can Edit | Can Delete | Categories |
|------|----------------|--------------|------------|----------|------------|------------|
| global_admin | ✅ View/Manage All | ✅ View All Teams | ✅ Global only | ✅ Global only | ✅ Global only | ✅ Full CRUD |
| team_admin | ✅ View only | ✅ View/Manage own team | ✅ Team only | ✅ Team only | ✅ Team only | ❌ View only |

For technical details on how the job queue system works, see [Job Queue System](/development/backend/job-queue).

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Sync**: One-click sync from official registry
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking sync via job queue
- **Rate Limiting**: Sequential processing with configurable delays
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of sync operations
- **GitHub Enhancement**: Automatic enrichment with GitHub metadata
- **Version Tracking**: Syncs version information from registry
- **Transport Detection**: Automatic detection of stdio, HTTP, or SSE transport
- **Environment Variable Mapping**: Intelligent mapping to three-tier configuration system

**For Global Administrators**: Use the "Sync Registry" button in the MCP Server Catalog admin interface to trigger a sync operation.

### GitHub Integration

Integration with GitHub repositories for automatic synchronization and metadata extraction. For complete details on setting up and using GitHub integration, see the [GitHub App Integration Guide](/general/github-application).

**Key Features:**
