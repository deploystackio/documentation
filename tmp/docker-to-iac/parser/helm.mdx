# Helm - Parser Full Documentation

The parser for Helm translates Docker configurations into Kubernetes Helm Charts. The parser logic can be found in GitHub inside the [docker-to-iac repo](https://github.com/deploystackio/docker-to-iac/blob/main/src/parsers/helm.ts).

## Parser language abbreviation for API

- `languageAbbreviation`: `HELM`.

## Prerequisite to deploy Helm Charts

To deploy the generated Helm Charts, you need:

- A Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud-based)
- Helm CLI installed (version 3.x recommended)
- Appropriate RBAC permissions to deploy resources in your target namespace

### Kubernetes Resources

The generated Helm Chart creates the following Kubernetes resources for each service in your Docker configuration:

- **Deployments**: Container specifications, replica count, resource limits
- **Services**: Network access to your pods with appropriate ports
- **ConfigMaps**: Non-sensitive environment variables
- **Secrets**: Sensitive environment variables (passwords, tokens, etc.)

### Database Support

For database services, the parser leverages Helm's dependency management to incorporate official Bitnami charts:

- **MySQL/MariaDB**: Uses Bitnami's MySQL/MariaDB chart
- **PostgreSQL**: Uses Bitnami's PostgreSQL chart
- **Redis**: Uses Bitnami's Redis chart
- **MongoDB**: Uses Bitnami's MongoDB chart

Each database dependency is configured with appropriate defaults and includes persistent storage for data.

## Default output format

- The default output format for this parser: `YAML`.

## File Configuration

The Helm parser generates a complete Helm Chart directory structure:

- `Chart.yaml` - The main chart definition with metadata and dependencies
- `values.yaml` - Configuration values that can be customized at deployment time
- `templates/` - Directory containing Kubernetes YAML templates:
  - `deployment.yaml` - Deployment specifications for each service
  - `service.yaml` - Service definitions for network access
  - `configmap.yaml` - ConfigMap for non-sensitive environment variables
  - `secret.yaml` - Secret for sensitive environment variables
  - `_helpers.tpl` - Helper functions for template generation
  - `NOTES.txt` - Usage instructions displayed after installation

This multi-file approach follows the standard Helm Chart structure and allows for maximum flexibility when deploying to Kubernetes.

## Supported Docker Compose Variables

This parser supports the following Docker Compose variables:

- `image`
- `environment`
- `ports`
- `command`
- `volumes`

The parser automatically detects sensitive environment variables (containing keywords like "password", "secret", "key", "token", or "auth") and places them in Kubernetes Secrets instead of ConfigMaps.

## Volume Support

The parser supports Docker volume mappings by converting them to Kubernetes volume mounts:

- Each volume is converted to a hostPath volume by default
- Volume names are sanitized to conform to Kubernetes naming conventions
- For production use, you should modify the generated templates to use more appropriate volume types (PersistentVolumeClaims, etc.)

## Database Integration

When a database service is detected (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB), the parser:

1. Adds the corresponding Bitnami Helm chart as a dependency in `Chart.yaml`
2. Configures database settings in `values.yaml`
3. Maps environment variables to the expected format for the database chart
4. Sets up appropriate persistence configurations

### Example Database Configuration

For a PostgreSQL database in your Docker Compose file:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: myuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
```

The parser will create:

```yaml
# In Chart.yaml
dependencies:
  - name: db
    repository: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    version: ^12.0.0
    condition: dependencies.db.enabled

# In values.yaml
dependencies:
  db:
    enabled: true
    auth:
      postgres:
        password: mypassword
      database: myapp
      username: myuser
      password: mypassword
    primary:
      service:
        ports:
          postgresql: 5432
      persistence:
        enabled: true
        size: 8Gi
```

## Service Connections

The parser supports service-to-service connections by leveraging Kubernetes DNS for service discovery. When a service refers to another service in an environment variable, the parser automatically configures the appropriate DNS references.

For example, if your `app` service connects to a `db` service:

```yaml
# Docker Compose
services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/mydb
  
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
```

The parser will create:

```yaml
# In ConfigMap template
data:
  DATABASE_URL: {{ include "deploystack.serviceReference" (dict "service" (index $.Values.services "db") "serviceKey" "db") }}
```

Which resolves to the Kubernetes DNS name: `db.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:5432`

## Multi Services Support

Multi `services` support for Helm: **yes**

Helm Charts are designed to handle multiple services and dependencies in a single deployment, making them ideal for complex applications. The parser transforms all services from your Docker Compose file into corresponding Kubernetes resources.

Please read more about [multi service support here](/docs/docker-to-iac/multi-services-support.md).

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the generated Helm Chart:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the generated chart
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   helm dependency update
   ```

3. Install the chart:

   ```bash
   helm install my-release .
   ```

4. For custom configurations:

   ```bash
   helm install my-release . --set services.app.replicaCount=2
   ```

## Production Considerations

For production deployments, consider the following modifications to the generated chart:

1. Replace hostPath volumes with appropriate persistent volume claims
2. Adjust resource limits in `values.yaml`
3. Configure proper ingress settings for external access
4. Enable and configure horizontal pod autoscaling
5. Set up proper liveness and readiness probes

The generated Helm Chart is a starting point that you should review and customize to match your production requirements and security best practices.
