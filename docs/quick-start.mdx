# Quick Start

Get started with DeployStack in minutes. This guide walks you through creating a free account, configuring your first MCP server, and connecting your development environment.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- A free DeployStack account with team management
- Your first MCP server configured with secure credentials
- The DeployStack Gateway running locally
- VS Code connected to your team's MCP tools

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- **VS Code or Cursor**: For MCP tool integration
- **A few minutes**: This entire setup takes less than 5 minutes

## Step 1: Create Your Free Account

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Sign Up for DeployStack**
    
    Visit [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) and create your free account:
    
    - Sign up with your email address or GitHub account
    - Complete email verification if required
    - You'll automatically get your own default team
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Explore Your Dashboard**
    
    Once logged in, you'll see:
    - **Teams**: Your personal default team (automatically created)
    - **MCP Catalog**: Browse available MCP servers
    - **Team Settings**: Manage your team and credentials
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure Your First MCP Server

Let's set up a popular MCP server to get you started quickly.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Browse the MCP Catalog**
    
    1. Navigate to the **MCP Catalog** in your dashboard
    2. Browse available MCP servers (GitHub, BrightData, Weather, etc.)
    3. Click on a server that interests you to see its details
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Add an MCP Server to Your Team**
    
    For this example, let's add the GitHub MCP server:
    
    1. Find "GitHub MCP Server" in the catalog
    2. Click **"Add to Team"**
    3. Select your default team
    4. You'll be prompted to add credentials
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Configure Credentials**
    
    Add your GitHub token securely:
    
    1. **Create a GitHub Token**: Go to [GitHub Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
    2. **Generate a new token** with appropriate permissions
    3. **Add to DeployStack**: Paste the token in the credentials field
    4. **Save**: Your credentials are encrypted and stored securely
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **Security Note**: Your credentials are encrypted and never exposed to your local environment. The DeployStack Gateway injects them securely at runtime.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Install and Configure the Gateway

The DeployStack Gateway runs locally and connects your development tools to your team's MCP servers.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Install the Gateway**
    
    Install the DeployStack Gateway globally via npm:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g @deploystack/gateway
    ```
    
    Verify the installation:
    
    ```bash
    deploystack --version
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Login to DeployStack**
    
    Authenticate with your DeployStack account:
    
    ```bash
    deploystack login
    ```
    
    This will:
    - Open a browser window for authentication
    - Download your team's MCP server configurations
    - Set up secure credential access
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Start the Gateway**
    
    Start the gateway to begin using your MCP servers:
    
    ```bash
    deploystack start
    ```
    
    The gateway will:
    - Start all your configured MCP servers as background processes
    - Expose them at `http://localhost:9095/sse`
    - Inject credentials securely without exposing them to you
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Verify Gateway Status**
    
    Check that everything is working:
    
    ```bash
    deploystack status
    ```
    
    You should see:
    - Gateway status: Running
    - Your team name
    - List of available MCP servers
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Connect Your Development Environment

Now connect VS Code or Cursor to use your team's MCP servers.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Configure VS Code MCP Settings**
    
    Open your VS Code settings and configure MCP to use the DeployStack Gateway.
    
    **Location**: `.vscode/settings.json` or global VS Code settings
    
    **Before** (manual MCP server management):
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["@github/mcp"],
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **After** (DeployStack Gateway):
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "deploystack": {
          "url": "http://localhost:9095/sse",
          "name": "DeployStack Gateway",
          "description": "Enterprise MCP Gateway with team-based access control"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Test MCP Connection**
    
    1. **Restart VS Code** to load the new MCP configuration
    2. **Open Claude or compatible MCP client**
    3. **Test a tool**: Try using one of your configured MCP servers
    4. **Verify**: Tools should work without any manual credential setup
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Explore Your Setup

Now that everything is connected, explore what you can do:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **List Available Tools**
    
    See all MCP tools available through your gateway:
    
    ```bash
    deploystack mcp
    ```
    
    This shows all tools from your team's MCP servers with their descriptions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Monitor Gateway Activity**
    
    View real-time logs and activity:
    
    ```bash
    deploystack logs
    ```
    
    This shows MCP server activity, tool usage, and any issues.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Manage Your Team**
    
    Back in the [DeployStack dashboard](https://cloud.deploystack.io):
    - Add more MCP servers to your team
    - Invite team members (if you have a team)
    - Monitor usage and activity
    - Manage credentials securely
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Gateway Commands

Here are the essential commands you'll use regularly:

```bash
# Check gateway status
deploystack status

# Start the gateway
deploystack start

# Stop the gateway
deploystack stop

# Restart the gateway
deploystack restart

# View logs
deploystack logs

# List available MCP tools
deploystack mcp

# Update configurations from cloud
deploystack sync

# Switch teams (if you have multiple)
deploystack teams
```

## Multiple Teams

If you're part of multiple teams or create additional teams:

```bash
# List your teams
deploystack teams

# Switch to a specific team
deploystack teams --switch 2

# Check current team context
deploystack status
```

When you switch teams, the gateway automatically:
- Downloads new team configurations
- Starts the new team's MCP servers
- Stops the previous team's servers
- Updates available tools

## What's Next?

### Add More MCP Servers

Expand your toolkit by adding more MCP servers:
- **BrightData**: Web scraping and data collection
- **Weather**: Weather information and forecasts
- **Database**: Connect to your databases
- **Custom Servers**: Add your own private MCP servers

### Team Collaboration

If you're working with a team:
- **[Invite Team Members](/onboard-new-team-members)**: Add developers to your team
- **[Manage Roles](/roles)**: Set up proper access control
- **[Team Management](/teams)**: Organize multiple projects

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway Won't Start

```bash
# Check if you're logged in
deploystack status

# Re-login if needed
deploystack login

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :9095
```

### MCP Tools Not Working

1. **Check gateway status**:
   ```bash
   deploystack status
   ```

2. **Verify VS Code configuration**:
   - Ensure the MCP server URL is `http://localhost:9095/sse`
   - Restart VS Code after configuration changes

3. **Check credentials**:
   - Verify credentials are properly configured in your dashboard
   - Test credentials directly in the DeployStack interface
