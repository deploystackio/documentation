# MCP Server Catalog

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Catalog is DeployStack's comprehensive system for discovering, managing, and deploying MCP servers. It provides a centralized repository where you can find pre-configured MCP servers, contribute your own, and manage deployments across your teams.

## What is the MCP Catalog?

The MCP Catalog serves as a marketplace and management system for MCP servers, offering:

- **Server Discovery**: Browse available MCP servers by category, language, and functionality
- **Team-Based Management**: Organize servers within your teams with proper access control
- **Version Management**: Track different versions of MCP servers with changelog support
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic synchronization with GitHub repositories
- **Global and Team Servers**: Support for both community-wide and team-specific servers

## Catalog Structure

### Server Visibility Levels

The catalog supports two types of servers:

#### Global Servers
- **Visibility**: Available to all users across the platform
- **Management**: Only Global Administrators can create, edit, and delete
- **Purpose**: Community-contributed servers, official integrations, popular tools
- **Examples**: Official OpenAI MCP server, popular GitHub integrations, common utilities

#### Team Servers
- **Visibility**: Only visible to team members
- **Management**: Team administrators can create, edit, and delete within their teams
- **Purpose**: Custom integrations, private tools, team-specific configurations
- **Examples**: Internal API integrations, custom business logic, proprietary tools

### Categories

Servers are organized into categories for easy discovery and filtering. Categories are simple organizational labels that group servers by their purpose or functionality.

For a complete explanation of how MCP categories work, see the [MCP Categories Guide](/deploystack/mcp-categories).

**Note**: Only Global Administrators can create and manage categories.

## User Permissions

Access to the MCP catalog is controlled by your role and team membership:

### Permission Matrix
