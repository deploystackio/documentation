# DeployStack Satellite Development

DeployStack Satellites are **edge workers** (similar to GitHub Actions runners) that manage MCP servers with enterprise-grade team isolation and security. This service represents DeployStack's strategic pivot from local CLI gateway to cloud-native MCP-as-a-Service platform.

## Current Implementation Status

The satellite service has completed **Phase 1: MCP Transport Implementation** with working external client interfaces:

- âœ… **Fastify HTTP Server** with Swagger API documentation
- âœ… **Pino Logging System** identical to backend configuration
- âœ… **MCP Transport Protocols** - SSE, SSE Messaging, Streamable HTTP
- âœ… **Session Management** with cryptographically secure session IDs
- âœ… **JSON-RPC 2.0 Protocol** compliance for MCP communication
- âœ… **TypeScript + Webpack** build system with full type safety
- âœ… **Development Workflow** with hot reload and linting
- ðŸš§ **MCP Server Process Management** (planned)
- ðŸš§ **Team Isolation** (planned)
- ðŸš§ **Backend Communication** (planned)

## Architecture Vision

Satellites implement a hybrid edge worker pattern with five core internal components:

- **HTTP Proxy Router**: Team-aware request routing with OAuth 2.1 authentication
- **Dual MCP Server Manager**: Manages both external HTTP endpoints and stdio subprocess MCP servers
- **Team Resource Manager**: Linux namespaces, cgroups, and resource jailing (0.1 CPU, 100MB RAM per process)
- **Communication Manager**: Handles stdio JSON-RPC and HTTP proxy communication
- **Backend Communicator**: Integration with DeployStack Backend for configuration and monitoring

## Deployment Models (Planned)

Satellites will support two deployment patterns:

- **Global Satellites**: DeployStack-operated cloud infrastructure serving all teams with resource isolation
- **Team Satellites**: Customer-deployed within corporate networks for internal resource access
- **Dual MCP Server Support**: Both HTTP proxy (external endpoints) and stdio subprocess (local) MCP servers

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **HTTP Framework**: Fastify with native JSON Schema validation
- **Logging**: Pino logger with structured logging
- **MCP Transport**: SSE, Streamable HTTP, Direct HTTP protocols
- **Session Management**: Cryptographically secure 32-byte session IDs
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 Resource Server (planned)
- **Process Management**: stdio subprocess management (planned)
- **Team Isolation**: Linux namespaces and cgroups (planned)
- **Build System**: TypeScript + Webpack
- **Development**: Nodemon with hot reload

## Quick Start

### Current Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
cd services/satellite
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit LOG_LEVEL, PORT as needed

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
# API docs: http://localhost:3001/documentation
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Development server with hot reload
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run release  # Release management
```

### Current MCP Transport Endpoints

- **GET** `/sse` - Establish SSE connection with session management
- **POST** `/message?session={id}` - Send JSON-RPC messages via SSE sessions
- **GET/POST** `/mcp` - Streamable HTTP transport with optional sessions
- **OPTIONS** `/mcp` - CORS preflight handling

### Testing MCP Transport

```bash
# Test SSE connection
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:3001/sse

# Send JSON-RPC message (replace SESSION_ID)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/message?session=SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"initialize","params":{}}'

# Direct HTTP transport
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

## Development Patterns

### MCP Transport Development
Follow established patterns when working with MCP transport:

1. Use manual JSON serialization with `JSON.stringify()`
2. Implement comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
3. Include structured logging with operation tracking
4. Handle session management and activity tracking
5. Support both streaming and standard response modes

### API Route Development
Follow established patterns when adding new routes:

1. Create route files in `src/routes/` directories
2. Use reusable JSON Schema constants for validation
3. Implement TypeScript interfaces for type safety
4. Use manual JSON serialization with `JSON.stringify()`
5. Register routes in `src/routes/index.ts`

### Logging Best Practices
- Use structured logging with context objects
- Pass logger instances as parameters to services
- Include operation identifiers for traceability
- Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Avoid console.log statements in favor of Pino logger

### Configuration Management
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Provide sensible defaults for development
- Document all configuration options
- Support both development and production modes

## Strategic Context

The satellite service represents DeployStack's evolution from a developer tool into a comprehensive enterprise MCP management platform. This strategic pivot addresses:

- **Adoption Friction**: Eliminates CLI installation barriers (12x better conversion)
- **Market Differentiation**: Creates new "MCP-as-a-Service" category
- **Enterprise Requirements**: Provides team isolation and compliance features
- **Scalability**: Enables horizontal scaling and global deployment

## Contributing

When contributing to satellite development:

1. **Follow Backend Patterns**: Use identical logging, validation, and error handling
2. **Maintain Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for compile-time validation
3. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation for new features
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure changes work in both development and production
5. **Consider Enterprise**: Design features with team isolation and security in mind
6. **MCP Compliance**: Ensure JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol compliance

## Next Steps

The satellite service has completed Phase 1 (MCP Transport Implementation) and is ready for Phase 2 development. The next major milestone is implementing MCP server process management, which will enable the core satellite functionality of managing MCP servers on behalf of teams.
