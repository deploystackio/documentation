# DeployStack Development

Welcome to the DeployStack development documentation! DeployStack is a comprehensive enterprise platform for deploying and managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, featuring a cloud control plane, local gateway proxy, and modern web interface for team-based MCP server orchestration.

## Architecture Overview

DeployStack implements a sophisticated Control Plane / Data Plane architecture for enterprise MCP server management:

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript web application providing the management interface for MCP server deployments
- **Backend**: Fastify-based cloud control plane handling authentication, team management, and configuration distribution
- **Gateway**: Local secure proxy that runs on developer machines, managing MCP server processes and credential injection
- **Shared**: Common utilities and TypeScript types used across all services
- **Dual Transport**: Supports both stdio (CLI tools) and SSE (VS Code) protocols for maximum compatibility

## Development Areas

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 8 or higher
- Git for version control
- DeployStack account at [cloud.deploystack.io](https://cloud.deploystack.io) (for gateway development)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deploystackio/deploystack.git
cd deploystack

# Install dependencies for all services
cd services/frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
cd ../gateway && npm install

# Start development servers (in separate terminals)
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd services/backend && npm run dev  # http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd services/frontend && npm run dev  # http://localhost:5173

# Terminal 3 - Gateway (optional, for local MCP testing)
cd services/gateway && npm run dev   # http://localhost:9095
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Choose Your Service**: Select frontend, backend, or gateway based on your contribution area
2. **Set Up Environment**: Follow the specific setup guides for your chosen service
3. **Understand Architecture**: Review how services interact (Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Gateway)
4. **Make Changes**: Implement features following established patterns (Vue SFC for frontend, plugins for backend, process management for gateway)
5. **Test**: Run comprehensive test suites for your service
6. **Submit**: Create pull requests following our contribution guidelines

## Key Technologies

### Frontend Stack
- **Vue 3** with Composition API and Single File Components (SFC)
- **TypeScript** for type safety throughout the application
- **Vite** for fast HMR and optimized builds
- **TailwindCSS** with shadcn-vue component library
- **Direct fetch()** API calls (no axios or API client libraries)
- **Vue I18n** for multi-language support

### Backend Stack
- **Fastify** for high-performance cloud control plane
- **TypeScript** with full type safety
- **Drizzle ORM** supporting SQLite and PostgreSQL
- **Zod** validation with automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Plugin System** with isolated routes (`/api/plugin/<id>/`)
- **Role-Based Access Control** with session management

### Gateway Stack
- **Node.js** process management runtime
- **Dual Transport** stdio for CLI tools, SSE for VS Code
- **Secure Credential Injection** without developer exposure
- **Process Manager** for persistent MCP server processes
- **Session Management** with cryptographic security
- **Team-Based Caching** for instant startup and tool discovery

## Development Philosophy

### Enterprise MCP Management
DeployStack provides enterprise-grade MCP server orchestration through:

- **Control Plane Architecture**: Cloud-based configuration management with local gateway execution
- **Security-First Design**: Credential injection without exposure, team-based access control
- **Universal Compatibility**: Supports MCP servers in any language (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust)
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless integration with VS Code, CLI tools, and development workflows
- **Process Persistence**: MCP servers run as managed background services with automatic lifecycle management

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout the stack
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear, up-to-date documentation
- **Security**: Built-in security best practices
