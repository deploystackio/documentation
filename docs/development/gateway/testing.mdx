# Gateway Testing

The DeployStack Gateway includes testing infrastructure for ensuring reliability and quality of the CLI application.

## Test Commands

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test:unit
```
Currently displays a placeholder message as tests are not yet implemented.

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```
Runs ESLint with automatic fixing of common issues. Essential for maintaining code quality.

### Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
```
Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript and verifies the build process.

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts the gateway in development mode with hot reload using `ts-node-dev`.

### Manual Testing
```bash
npm run link
```
Links the local gateway for testing CLI commands globally.

After linking, test commands directly:
```bash
deploystack version
deploystack status
deploystack --help
```

## Release Testing

### Pre-release Checks
```bash
npm run release
```
Runs linting checks before creating a release through `release-it`.

### CI/CD Testing
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs:
- Build verification
- Linting checks
- Unit tests (when implemented)

## Testing Strategy

### CLI-Specific Testing
- **Command validation**: Ensure all commands parse correctly
- **Output formatting**: Verify chalk styling and user messages
- **Error handling**: Test failure scenarios and exit codes
- **Cross-platform**: Validate behavior on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Integration Points
- **Authentication flows**: Test login/logout workflows
- **Configuration management**: Verify config file operations
- **Process management**: Test MCP server spawning and cleanup
- **Proxy functionality**: Validate HTTP proxy routing

## Future Testing Implementation

The gateway will include comprehensive testing using:
- **vitest** for unit testing
- **supertest** for HTTP endpoint testing
- **msw** for API mocking
- Cross-platform testing in CI/CD

## Development Tips

### Quick Validation
```bash
# Check command structure
deploystack --help

# Verify version info
deploystack version

# Test error handling
deploystack invalid-command
```

### Build and Test Cycle
```bash
npm run lint    # Fix code style issues
npm run build   # Verify compilation
npm run link    # Test locally
```

This testing approach ensures the gateway maintains high quality while remaining focused on the essential CLI functionality.
