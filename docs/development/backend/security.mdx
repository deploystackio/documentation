# Security Policy

This document outlines security procedures and policies for the backend service.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly. Please email us at [SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE - *you'll need to replace this*] with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report promptly and work with you to understand and address the issue. We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to remediate it.

## Password Hashing

User passwords are never stored in plaintext. We employ a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm to protect user credentials.

- **Algorithm:** We will use `argon2id`, which is a part of the Argon2 family of algorithms (Argon2id is generally recommended as it provides resistance against both side-channel attacks and GPU cracking attacks).
- **Salt Generation:** A unique, cryptographically secure salt is automatically generated for each user's password by the `argon2` library at the time of account creation or password change. This salt is then stored as part of the resulting hash string.
- **Parameters:** We use appropriate parameters for `argon2` (e.g., memory cost, time cost, and parallelism) to ensure that the hashing process is computationally intensive, making brute-force attacks significantly more difficult. These parameters are chosen to balance security with acceptable performance on our servers and may be adjusted based on hardware improvements over time.
- **Verification:** During login, the provided password and the stored salt (extracted from the hash string) are used to re-compute the hash. This newly computed hash is then compared against the stored hash in a constant-time manner (handled by the `argon2` library's verify function) to help prevent timing attacks.

This approach ensures that even if the database were compromised, recovering the original passwords would be computationally infeasible.

## Session Management

User sessions are managed using `lucia-auth` v3.

- Session identifiers are cryptographically random (40 characters) generated using Lucia's `generateId()` function and stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks from accessing them.
- Sessions have defined expiration times (30 days from creation) to limit the window of opportunity for session hijacking.
- Session data is stored in the `authSession` table with proper foreign key constraints to the `authUser` table.
- Session cookies are configured with appropriate security attributes:
  - `httpOnly`: true (prevents JavaScript access)
  - `secure`: true in production (HTTPS only)
  - `sameSite`: 'lax' (CSRF protection)

## Data Validation

All incoming data from clients (e.g., API request bodies, URL parameters) is rigorously validated using `zod` schemas on the server-side before being processed. This helps prevent common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and unexpected data handling errors.

- Registration endpoint validates: username, email, password, first_name, last_name
- **Email verification endpoint validates: verification token format and expiration**
- Email addresses are normalized to lowercase before storage
- Duplicate username and email checks are performed before user creation
- **Email verification status is checked during login when verification is enabled**
- All database operations use parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM to prevent SQL injection

## Email Verification

Email verification is implemented to ensure account ownership and prevent unauthorized account creation.

- **Verification Tokens:** Cryptographically secure tokens generated using `generateId(32)` (256-bit entropy)
- **Token Expiration:** Verification tokens expire after 24 hours to limit exposure window
- **Token Storage:** Tokens are stored hashed in the database using the same argon2 parameters as passwords
- **Secure Links:** Verification links use HTTPS in production and include the full token in query parameters
- **Token Validation:** Constant-time comparison used for token verification to prevent timing attacks
- **Single Use:** Tokens are invalidated immediately after successful verification
- **Account Security:** Unverified accounts cannot log in when email verification is enabled via `global.send_mail` setting
- **Global Administrator Exception:** The first registered user (global administrator) is automatically verified for system access
- **Database Schema Security:** `email_verified` boolean field with secure default (false)
- **Cleanup Mechanism:** Expired tokens are automatically cleaned up to prevent database bloat

## Global Settings Encryption

Sensitive global application settings (SMTP credentials, API keys, etc.) are encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption.

- **Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation:** Scrypt with salt for key derivation from environment secret
- **Authenticated Encryption:** Prevents tampering with encrypted data
- **Unique Initialization Vectors:** Each encryption operation uses a unique IV
- **Environment-Based Key:** Encryption key derived from `DEPLOYSTACK_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` environment variable
- **Additional Authenticated Data (AAD):** Extra security layer to prevent data manipulation

This approach ensures that sensitive configuration data remains secure even if the database is compromised. The encryption system is separate from password hashing to maintain proper separation of concerns.

## OAuth2 Server Security

The OAuth2 server implementation follows RFC 6749 and RFC 7636 security standards for API access authentication.

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- **Algorithm:** SHA256 code challenge method (RFC 7636)
- **Code Verifier:** Cryptographically random 43-128 character string
- **Code Challenge:** Base64URL-encoded SHA256 hash of code verifier
- **Protection:** Prevents authorization code interception attacks

### Token Security
- **Access Tokens:** JWT format with 1-hour expiration
- **Refresh Tokens:** Cryptographically random with 30-day expiration
- **Token Storage:** Argon2 hashed in database (same parameters as passwords)
- **Token Cleanup:** Automatic hourly cleanup of expired tokens
- **Scope Validation:** Fine-grained permissions (`mcp:read`, `account:read`, `user:read`, `teams:read`, `offline_access`)

### Authorization Flow Security
- **State Parameter:** CSRF protection with cryptographically random state
- **Client Validation:** Hardcoded client credentials for `deploystack-gateway-cli`
- **Redirect URI Validation:** Whitelist of allowed callback URLs
- **Consent Page:** User authorization with security warnings
- **Session Binding:** OAuth2 flow requires active user session

### Bearer Token Authentication
- **Header Format:** `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- **Token Verification:** Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- **Scope Enforcement:** Middleware validates required scopes per endpoint
- **Dual Authentication:** Seamless support for both cookies and Bearer tokens

For implementation details, see the [Backend OAuth Implementation Guide](/development/backend/oauth-providers).
