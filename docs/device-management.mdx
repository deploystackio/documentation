# Device Management

DeployStack automatically tracks and manages devices across your organization to enable secure multi-device MCP configurations, enterprise governance, and seamless user experiences. Every device that accesses DeployStack is registered and managed through our comprehensive device management system.

## Why Device Management Matters

Device management is essential for DeployStack's three-tier MCP configuration system and enterprise security:

**🏢 Enterprise Governance**
- **Visibility**: Administrators can see which devices access which MCP servers across the organization
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trails for regulatory requirements and security policies
- **Access Control**: Ability to manage and revoke device access when needed
- **Risk Management**: Identify and respond to unauthorized or compromised devices

**👥 Team Collaboration**
- **Multi-Device Workflows**: Users seamlessly work across laptops, desktops, and cloud workstations
- **Device-Specific Configurations**: Different MCP settings for different environments (development vs. production machines)
- **Team Visibility**: Team administrators can see device usage patterns and optimize configurations

**🔒 Security & Trust**
- **Device Authentication**: Each device is uniquely identified and authenticated
- **Hardware Fingerprinting**: Secure device identification based on system characteristics
- **Trust Management**: Mark devices as trusted or untrusted based on organizational policies
- **Automatic Registration**: Devices are registered securely during OAuth2 login flow

## How Device Registration Works

Device registration happens automatically and securely during the CLI login process:

### Automatic Registration Process

1. **User Initiates Login**: User runs `deploystack login` command
2. **OAuth2 Flow Begins**: Standard OAuth2 authorization with PKCE security
3. **Device Detection**: Gateway automatically detects device information:
   - Device name (hostname)
   - Hardware fingerprint (unique identifier based on MAC addresses and system info)
   - Operating system and version
   - System architecture
   - Node.js version for compatibility
4. **Secure Registration**: Device info is included in OAuth2 token exchange
5. **Backend Processing**: Device is registered or updated in the database
6. **User Confirmation**: User sees "📱 Device registered: [device-name]" message

### Security Benefits of Integrated Registration

- **No Separate Endpoints**: Device registration only happens during authenticated login sessions
- **OAuth2 Security**: Leverages existing OAuth2 security with PKCE
- **Hardware Fingerprinting**: Unique device identification without user input
- **Automatic Process**: No manual device management required

For technical details on the OAuth2 integration, see [Gateway OAuth Implementation](/development/gateway/oauth#automatic-device-registration).

## Device Information Collected

DeployStack collects minimal device information necessary for identification and configuration management:

**🔍 Device Identification**
- **Device Name**: User-friendly name (defaults to hostname, can be customized)
- **Hardware ID**: Unique fingerprint based on MAC addresses and system characteristics
- **Hostname**: System hostname for identification

**💻 System Information**
- **Operating System**: Type and version (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **Architecture**: System architecture (x64, arm64, etc.)
- **Node.js Version**: For compatibility tracking and troubleshooting
- **User Agent**: CLI version and platform information

**📊 Usage Metadata**
- **Last Login**: When the device was last used for authentication
- **Last Activity**: Most recent MCP server interaction
- **Trust Status**: Whether the device is marked as trusted
- **Active Status**: Whether the device is currently active

## Multi-Device User Experience

Users can seamlessly work across multiple devices with device-specific configurations:

### Device-Specific MCP Configurations

Each device maintains its own personal MCP configuration while inheriting team settings:

**Example: Filesystem MCP Server**
- **MacBook Pro**: `/Users/alice/Development`, `/Users/alice/Projects`
- **Work Desktop**: `C:\Users\alice\Projects`, `C:\Company\Shared`
- **Cloud Workstation**: `/home/alice/workspace`, `/data/projects`

**Shared Team Settings** (inherited on all devices):
- Team API keys and credentials
- Shared project directories
- Team-wide configuration standards

### Device Management Interface

Users can manage their devices through the DeployStack interface:

```
Your Devices

📱 MacBook Pro (Current Device)
   ├─ Last Login: 2 minutes ago
   ├─ Status: Active, Trusted
   ├─ MCP Configurations: 5 active
   └─ [Configure] [View Details]

🖥️ Work Desktop
   ├─ Last Login: Yesterday
   ├─ Status: Active, Trusted
   ├─ MCP Configurations: 3 active
   └─ [Configure] [View Details]

☁️ Cloud Workstation
   ├─ Last Login: 3 days ago
   ├─ Status: Inactive
   ├─ MCP Configurations: 2 configured
   └─ [Configure] [Reactivate]
```

## Administrator Perspective

### Enterprise Device Visibility

Administrators have comprehensive visibility into device usage across the organization:

**📊 Device Analytics Dashboard**
- Total devices across all teams
- Active vs. inactive device counts
- Device types and operating systems
- MCP server usage by device
- Security alerts and untrusted devices

**🔍 Device Search and Filtering**
- Search by user, team, or device name
- Filter by operating system, trust status, or activity
- View device-specific MCP configurations
- Export device reports for compliance

### Security Management

**🛡️ Device Trust Management**
- Mark devices as trusted or untrusted
- Automatically trust devices from known networks
- Require manual approval for new devices
- Bulk trust management for organizational devices

**🚨 Security Monitoring**
- Detect unusual device activity patterns
- Alert on new device registrations
- Monitor for potential security threats
- Track device access to sensitive MCP servers

**⚙️ Device Policies**
- Set maximum devices per user

## Integration with MCP Configuration System

Device management is deeply integrated with DeployStack's three-tier MCP configuration system:

### Device-Specific User Configurations

The user tier of the configuration system is inherently device-aware:

- **Template Level**: Global admin defines what can be configured (device-independent)
- **Team Level**: Team admin sets shared settings (inherited by all user devices)
- **User Level**: Individual users configure personal settings **per device**

For complete details on the three-tier system, see [MCP Configuration System](/mcp-configuration).

### Configuration Assembly by Device

When a user accesses MCP servers, configurations are assembled per device:

```
Final Configuration = Template + Team + User (This Device)

Template (Global): Command, package, system flags
+ Team (Shared): API keys, shared directories, team standards
+ User Device (Personal): Device-specific paths, preferences, debug settings
= Runtime Configuration for This Device
```
