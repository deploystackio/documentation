# Device Management (Legacy)

**⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This feature has been removed as part of DeployStack's strategic pivot to Satellite Service. Users now simply add URLs to VS Code instead of installing CLI software, eliminating the need for device tracking.

## Strategic Context

As documented in [ADR-000: Strategic Decision - Gateway to Satellite](/adr/strategic-decision-gateway-to-satellite), DeployStack has evolved from a CLI-based gateway solution to a **MCP-as-a-Service platform**. This change eliminated the need for device management because:

- **Zero Installation Required**: Users add URLs instead of installing CLI software
- **No Local Processes**: Satellite infrastructure handles MCP servers remotely
- **Simplified Security Model**: Standard HTTPS authentication replaces device fingerprinting
- **Better User Experience**: "Just add a URL" vs. complex device registration

## What Was Removed

The following device management features were removed:

- **Device Registration**: Automatic device detection during OAuth2 login
- **Device Tracking**: Hardware fingerprinting and device metadata collection
- **Device Management APIs**: CRUD operations for device lifecycle
- **Device-Specific Configurations**: Per-device MCP server settings
- **Enterprise Device Analytics**: Device usage monitoring and reporting

## Migration to Satellite Service

For users migrating from the old device-based system:

### Before (Gateway CLI with Device Management)
```bash
# Complex device-aware workflow
deploystack login  # Device registered automatically
deploystack start  # Local process management
# VS Code: http://localhost:9095/sse
```

### After (Satellite Service)
```bash
# Simple URL-based workflow
# 1. Register at cloud.deploystack.io
# 2. Copy JWT token
# 3. VS Code: https://satellite.deploystack.io/mcp
```

### Configuration Changes

**Device-Specific Settings (Removed)**:
- Per-device MCP server configurations
- Device-specific environment variables
- Hardware-based access control

**Satellite Configurations (New)**:
- User-level MCP settings (not device-specific)
- JWT token-based authentication
- Team-shared configurations

## Remaining User Configuration System

While device management was removed, DeployStack still supports user-specific configurations through the three-tier system:

1. **Template Level**: Global admin defines MCP server capabilities
2. **Team Level**: Team settings shared across all team members
3. **User Level**: Individual user preferences (no longer device-specific)

For details, see [MCP Configuration System](/mcp-configuration).

## Alternative Solutions

For organizations that previously relied on device management features:

### Instead of Device Tracking
- **Use JWT Tokens**: Standard OAuth2 authentication
- **Monitor at User Level**: Track usage by user, not device
- **Team-Based Analytics**: Focus on team productivity metrics

### Instead of Device-Specific Configurations
- **User Preferences**: Configure settings per user (applies across all their devices)
- **Team Satellites**: Deploy on-premise satellites for internal resources
- **Environment-Based Settings**: Configure by environment (dev/staging/prod)

### Instead of Device Security
- **OAuth2 + PKCE**: Industry-standard authentication flow
- **JWT Token Management**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh capability
- **Team Access Control**: Manage permissions at team level

## Technical Implementation Notes

The device management removal involved:

### Database Schema Changes
- Removed `devices` table entirely
- Updated `mcpUserConfigurations` to remove device foreign key
- Added optional `device_name` field for basic identification

### OAuth2 Flow Simplification
- Removed device registration from token exchange
- Simplified request/response schemas
- Eliminated device-related API endpoints

### Service Layer Cleanup
- Removed `DeviceService` and `DeviceActivityService`
- Removed device management routes
- Updated OAuth2 token handler

## Benefits of the Removal

Removing device management aligns with DeployStack's strategic goals:

### For Users
- **Simpler Onboarding**: No device registration steps
- **Faster Setup**: URL configuration in under 3 minutes
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Same experience on all devices
- **No Installation Friction**: Works immediately without local software

### For DeployStack
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler architecture and codebase
- **Better Scalability**: Satellite infrastructure scales independently
- **Market Differentiation**: "First MCP-as-a-Service" positioning
- **Viral Growth**: "Just add this URL" sharing model

## Historical Context

Device management was essential for the Gateway CLI approach because:
- Local CLI installations required device tracking
- Process management needed device-specific state
- Enterprise features demanded device visibility
- Multi-device workflows required device coordination

With Satellite Service, these requirements disappeared because the infrastructure is managed remotely and accessed via standard web protocols.
