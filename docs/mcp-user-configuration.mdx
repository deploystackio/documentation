# MCP User Configuration and Personal Settings

Individual users customize personal MCP settings within boundaries set by their team administrators. You configure only the settings made available to you, focusing on personal productivity while automatically inheriting secure team credentials and standards.

## Overview

As a user, you personalize your MCP server experience within team-defined boundaries:

- **Personal Settings** that adapt to your individual workflow
- **Multi-Device Support** for different computers and environments  
- **Automatic Team Integration** with shared credentials and team standards
- **Simplified Interface** showing only settings you can modify
- **Secure Experience** without credential management burden

The user tier builds on team configurations, which build on global schemas. For an overview of the complete system, see [MCP Configuration System](/mcp-configuration).

## Configuration Boundaries

Your configuration options are precisely determined by how global administrators categorized elements during schema creation and your team administrator's lock/unlock decisions:

**ðŸ”“ You Can Configure:**
- **Unlocked Elements** - Settings your team admin made available for personal customization
- **User-Specific Elements** - Settings designed for individual workflow (like local file paths)
- **Device-Specific Settings** - Different configurations for different computers

**ðŸ”’ You Cannot See or Modify:**
- **Locked Team Settings** - Shared configuration controlled by team administrators
- **Hidden Credentials** - API keys and secrets managed securely by your team
- **Template Elements** - System-level parameters locked by global administrators

**ðŸ”— You Automatically Inherit:**
- **Team Credentials** - API keys and authentication tokens
- **Team Standards** - Shared settings and organizational preferences
- **Template Configuration** - System-level parameters locked by global administrators

For details on how global administrators define these boundaries and team administrators control access, see [Admin Schema Workflow](/mcp-admin-schema-workflow) and [Team Installation](/mcp-team-installation).

## User Interface Experience

When you configure an MCP server, you see a clean interface focused only on your personal options:

```
Personal Configuration: "Development Team Filesystem"

YOUR PERSONAL SETTINGS

Device: MacBook Pro â–¼ [Change Device]

Personal Directories (Add directories you want to access):
â”œâ”€ /Users/alice/Development
â”œâ”€ /Users/alice/Projects  
â””â”€ [+] Add another directory

Debug Settings:
â”œâ”€ Enable Debug Mode: âœ“
â””â”€ Debug Level: Verbose â–¼

TEAM-MANAGED SETTINGS (You inherit these automatically)

âœ“ Team credentials configured
âœ“ Shared project access: /company/projects
âœ“ Team backup settings: Enabled

[Save Configuration] [Test Configuration]
```

**Key Interface Features:**
- **Only Personal Options** - You see only settings you can modify
- **Clear Inheritance** - Understanding of what you get from your team
- **Device Context** - Configure settings for specific devices
- **Validation** - Immediate feedback on configuration validity

## Multi-Device Support

DeployStack supports different configurations for each device you use:

**Device Examples:**
- **"MacBook Pro"** - Your personal laptop with development setup
- **"Work Desktop"** - Office computer with different directory structure  
- **"Cloud Workstation"** - Remote development environment

**Adding a New Device:**
1. **Device Detection** - System identifies this as a new device
2. **Device Naming** - You provide a meaningful name
3. **Configuration Setup** - Configure personal settings for this device
4. **Team Inheritance** - Automatically inherit all team settings

Each device maintains its own personal configuration while sharing team settings.

## Personal Configuration Types

### User Arguments

Most commonly, you'll configure:

**Directory Paths:**
- Local directories you want MCP servers to access
- Personal project folders
- Document directories
- Workspace locations

**Example:**
```
Personal Directories:
â”œâ”€ /Users/alice/Development
â”œâ”€ /Users/alice/Projects
â””â”€ /Users/alice/Documents/Work
```

### User Environment Variables

**Personal Preferences:**
- Debug settings and logging levels
- Interface customization options
- Cache and temporary file locations

**Device-Specific Settings:**
- Local file paths and cache directories
- Hardware-specific optimizations
- Network and connection preferences

## Configuration Process

When you first configure an MCP server:

1. **Access Team Installation** - Navigate to your team's MCP server installations
2. **Select Server** - Choose the server you want to configure personally
3. **Device Setup** - Provide a name for your current device
4. **Personal Configuration** - Configure only the unlocked elements
5. **Validation** - System validates your configuration against team schema
6. **Save and Deploy** - Personal configuration is saved and ready to use

## Configuration Assembly

Your final MCP server configuration combines settings from all three tiers:

```
Final Configuration = Template + Team + Your Personal Settings

Template (System):
â”œâ”€ Command: "npx"
â”œâ”€ Package: "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
â””â”€ System flags: "-y"

+ Team (Shared):
â”œâ”€ Team API Key: "team-secret-12345" (hidden from you)
â”œâ”€ Shared directory: "/company/projects"
â””â”€ Backup enabled: true

+ Your Personal (Device):
â”œâ”€ Your directories: ["/Users/alice/Development", "/Users/alice/Projects"]
â”œâ”€ Debug: true
â””â”€ Log level: "verbose"

= Final Runtime Configuration:
Command: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem 
         /Users/alice/Development /Users/alice/Projects
Environment: {
  "TEAM_API_KEY": "team-secret-12345",
  "SHARED_DIR": "/company/projects", 
  "BACKUP_ENABLED": "true",
  "DEBUG": "true",
  "LOG_LEVEL": "verbose"
}
```

**Automatic Validation:**
- Your settings are validated against the schema
- Type checking ensures correct data formats
- Invalid directory paths are caught before saving
- Missing required fields are highlighted
