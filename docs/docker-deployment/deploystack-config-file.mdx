# DeployStack Configuration File Reference

The `.deploystack/config.yml` file allows you to customize how your application appears in the DeployStack catalog and deployment interfaces. This configuration file supports automatic validation in popular IDEs through SchemaStore integration.

## Configuration File Location

Create a `config.yml` file in your repository's `.deploystack` directory:

```bash
your-repository/
├── .deploystack/
│   ├── config.yml
│   └── docker-compose.yml (example, or docker-run.txt)
└── README.md
```

## Basic Configuration

Here's a minimal configuration example:

```yaml
application:
  name: "My Application"
  description: "A scalable web application with Redis caching"
  logo: "https://example.com/path/to/logo.png"
```

## Configuration Options

### Application Settings

When you submit a repository to DeployStack, we automatically use:

- Repository name as the application name
- Repository description as the application description

You can override these values using the `config.yml` (only on your main branch) file:

| Property | Type | Description | Constraints |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `mappings` | Array | Defines relationships between services for connection configuration | Required |
| `mappings[].fromService` | String | Service that needs to connect to another service | Required |
| `mappings[].toService` | String | Service being connected to | Required |
| `mappings[].environmentVariables` | Array of Strings | Environment variable names that reference the target service | Required |
| `mappings[].property` | String | Type of connection property to reference (e.g., 'connectionString', 'hostport') | Optional, defaults to 'hostport' |

The override process follows this order:

1. DeployStack first uses your repository name and description
2. If present, values in `.deploystack/config.yml` override the repository metadata

### Branch Deployment Settings

Before configuring multiple branch deployments, ensure you have installed the [DeployStack Repository Sync GitHub App](/deploystack/github-application), as it's required for branch monitoring and template updates.

You can configure multiple branch deployments using the `deployment.branches` section:

| Property | Type | Description | Constraints |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `label` | String | Display name for the branch | Maximum 20 characters |
| `description` | String | Explain the branch's purpose or version | Maximum 100 characters |
| `active` | Boolean | Whether this branch is available for deployment | Optional, defaults to true |
| `priority` | Number | Order in which branches appear (lower numbers first) | Minimum value: 1 |
| `exclude_providers` | Array | Optional list of cloud providers to exclude from template generation for this branch | Values must be valid provider codes: "aws", "rnd", "dop" |

The default branch always has `priority: 0` and appears first in the deployment options, regardless of other branch priorities.

Example configuration for multiple branches:

```yaml
application:
  name: "My Application"
  description: "A scalable web application"

deployment:
  branches:
    v2:
      label: "Beta (v2.x)"
      description: "Preview of upcoming v2.x release"
      priority: 1
      exclude_providers:
        - "aws"  # Exclude AWS CloudFormation for this branch
    v3:
      label: "Alpha (v3.x)"
      description: "Early preview of v3.x"
      priority: 2
```

Each branch configuration allows you to:

- Provide a user-friendly label for the version
- Include a description explaining the branch's purpose
- Control deployment availability with the `active` flag
- Set display order using `priority`

When multiple branches are configured:

- DeployStack generates separate deployment templates for each branch
- Users can choose which version to deploy
- The GitHub App monitors all configured branches for updates
- The default branch is always listed first with implicit `priority: 0`

This is especially useful for projects that maintain multiple active versions simultaneously, such as stable and beta releases.

The optional `exclude_providers` array allows you to specify which cloud providers should be excluded from template generation for particular branches. This is useful when certain features in a branch version may not be compatible with specific cloud providers. Valid provider codes are:

Please check our [current supported provider list here](/docker-to-iac/parser/index).

For example, if your beta version uses features only supported in DigitalOcean, you might exclude the other providers:

```yaml
v2-beta:
  label: "Beta"
  description: "Beta version with DigitalOcean-specific features"
  exclude_providers:
    - "aws"
    - "rnd"
```

If no providers are excluded, templates will be generated for all supported cloud providers.

### Service Connections

You can configure service-to-service communication for multi-container applications using the `serviceConnections` property within each branch configuration. This feature is particularly useful for applications where services need to communicate with each other (e.g., web apps connecting to databases).

| Property | Type | Description | Constraints |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `mappings` | Array | Defines relationships between services for connection configuration | Required |
| `mappings[].fromService` | String | Service that needs to connect to another service | Required |
| `mappings[].toService` | String | Service being connected to | Required |
| `mappings[].environmentVariables` | Array of Strings | Environment variable names that reference the target service | Required |

Example configuration for service connections:

```yaml
deployment:
  branches:
    main:
      label: "Production"
      description: "Production release"
      serviceConnections:
        mappings:
          - fromService: "app"
            toService: "db"
            environmentVariables:
              - "DATABASE_HOST"
              - "DATABASE_URL"
            property: "connectionString"
          - fromService: "frontend"
            toService: "api"
            environmentVariables:
              - "API_URL"
            property: "hostport"
```

This configuration tells DeployStack how to properly configure communication between:

- The "app" service and the "db" service through the DATABASE_HOST and DATABASE_URL environment variables
- The "frontend" service and the "api" service through the API_URL environment variable

When templates are generated, DeployStack will transform these environment variables according to each cloud provider's specific service discovery mechanism:

- For Render.com: Uses Blueprint's `fromService` syntax
- For DigitalOcean App Platform: Uses direct service name references

For example, if your docker-compose.yml contains:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: node:alpine
    environment:
      DATABASE_HOST: db
  db:
    image: mariadb:latest
```

The generated Render.com template would transform DATABASE_HOST to use their service discovery syntax:

```yaml
services:
  - name: app
    # ...other configuration...
    envVars:
      - key: DATABASE_HOST
        fromService:
          name: db
          type: pserv
          property: hostport
```

## Schema Validation

The configuration file is automatically validated against our JSON Schema when using supported IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.). The schema is available at:

```bash
https://cdnx.deploystack.io/schema/config.yml.json
```

## Notes

- Changes to the configuration file are only processed when made on your repository's default branch
- The logo URL must be accessible and point to a valid image file
- All configuration properties are optional, but providing them improves your application's visibility in the DeployStack catalog

## Usage Examples

### Override Repository Metadata

```yaml
application:
  name: "Redis Cache Manager"      # Overrides repository name
  description: "A more detailed description that better explains your application"  # Overrides repository description
  logo: "https://example.com/logos/redis-manager.png"
```

### Configure Multiple Branch Deployments with Service Connections

```yaml
deployment:
  branches:
    stable:
      label: "Stable"
      description: "Production-ready version"
      priority: 1
      serviceConnections:
        mappings:
          - fromService: "web"
            toService: "api"
            environmentVariables:
              - "API_ENDPOINT"
          - fromService: "api"
            toService: "db"
            environmentVariables:
              - "DB_HOST"
              - "DB_CONNECTION"
    
    beta:
      label: "Beta"
      description: "Preview of upcoming features"
      priority: 2
      exclude_providers:
        - "aws"  # Beta version not supported on AWS
      serviceConnections:
        mappings:
          - fromService: "web"
            toService: "api"
            environmentVariables:
              - "API_ENDPOINT"
```
