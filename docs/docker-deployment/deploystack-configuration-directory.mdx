# .deploystack Directory Reference

The `.deploystack` directory in your repository contains configuration files that DeployStack uses to generate and maintain your Infrastructure as Code templates. Creating this repo allows you to enable the [lifecycle of IaC](/docker-deployment/iac-lifecycle). The deploystack configurations repo only makes sense if you also [install DeployStack GitHub app](/docker-deployment/github-application). Otherwise, changes to DeployStack backend will not be recognized.

<Callout>
`.deploystack` directory is optional. You don't need to create it to submit your repository to deploystack.io.
</Callout>

## Directory Structure

```bash
.deploystack/
├── docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose configuration
├── docker-run.txt      # Docker run command
├── env                 # Environment variables (optional)
```

## Configuration Files

### DeployStack Configuration File

Please read more at [DeployStack Configuration File Reference](/docker-deployment/deploystack-config-file).

### Docker Configuration

Choose one of the following:

- `docker-compose.yml` - Standard Docker Compose configuration
- `docker-run.txt` - Single Docker run command

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

Example `docker-run.txt`:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx:alpine
```

### Environment Variables

Please read more from our [environment variables](/docker-deployment/docker-environment-variables) page.

## Automatic Updates

When the [DeployStack GitHub App](/docker-deployment/github-application) is installed:

1. Changes to specific (`docker-compose.yml` & `docker-run.txt`) file in `.deploystack/` trigger template updates
2. Updates only process when changes occur on the default branch
3. New templates are generated and stored in the [deploy-templates](https://github.com/deploystackio/deploy-templates) repository

## Important Notes

- The `.deploystack` directory is **optional**
- Without this directory, automatic template updates are **not** available
- You can add the directory and install the [DeployStack GitHub Sync App](/docker-deployment/github-application) at any time
- [Environment variables](/docker-deployment/docker-environment-variables) and [DeployStack config](/docker-deployment/deploystack-config-file) are optional components
- Only one Docker configuration file should be used (either compose or run)
