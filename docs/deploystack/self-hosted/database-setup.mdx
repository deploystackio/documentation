# Database Setup for Self-Hosting

## Overview

When you first start your self-hosted DeployStack instance, you'll need to choose and configure a database. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.

**Important**: This setup only needs to be done once when you first install DeployStack.

## What You'll Need

- Your DeployStack instance running (backend and frontend)
- Access to your server's environment variables (if choosing cloud databases)
- About 5-10 minutes to complete the setup

## Step 1: Access the Setup Page

1. **Start your DeployStack instance** following your installation guide
2. **Open your web browser** and navigate to your DeployStack URL
3. **You'll be automatically redirected** to the setup page at `/setup`

If you see a message like "Database setup required" or are redirected to a setup page, you're in the right place!

## Step 2: Choose Your Database

You'll see two database options. Here's what each one means:

### Option 1: SQLite (Recommended for Most Users)
- **Best for**: Small to medium teams, development, testing
- **Pros**: 
  - No additional setup required
  - Works immediately
  - No external dependencies
  - Perfect for getting started
- **Cons**: 
  - Single server only (no clustering)
  - Limited to one database file

**Choose this if**: You're just getting started, have a small team, or want the simplest setup.

### Option 2: Turso (For Advanced Users)
- **Best for**: Advanced users needing distributed databases
- **Pros**: 
  - Multi-region replication
  - Advanced SQLite features
  - Good performance
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires Turso account
  - More complex setup

**Choose this if**: You need advanced database features or multi-region deployment.

## Step 3: Configure Your Chosen Database

### If You Chose SQLite (Easiest)

1. **Select "SQLite"** from the options
2. **Click "Setup Database"**
3. **Wait for confirmation** (usually takes 10-30 seconds)
4. **Done!** You'll be redirected to the main application

No additional configuration needed - SQLite works out of the box!

### If You Chose Turso

Before you can use Turso, you need to set up environment variables:

#### Prerequisites
1. **Create a Turso account** at [turso.tech](https://turso.tech)
2. **Install Turso CLI** and create a database:
   ```bash
   turso db create deploystack-db
   ```
3. **Get your database URL and auth token**:
   ```bash
   turso db show deploystack-db
   turso db tokens create deploystack-db
   ```

#### Server Configuration
Add these environment variables to your server:

```bash
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-database-url
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
```

#### Complete Setup
1. **Restart your DeployStack instance** after setting the environment variables
2. **Go back to the setup page** (`/setup`)
3. **Select "Turso"**
4. **Click "Setup Database"**
5. **Wait for confirmation**

## Step 4: Verify Setup

After successful setup, you should:

1. **See a success message** confirming database initialization
2. **Be redirected to the main application**
3. **Be able to create your first user account**

If you see any errors, check the troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting

### "Database setup has already been performed"
- This means your database is already configured
- You can proceed to use the application normally
- If you need to change databases, contact your system administrator

### "Configuration incomplete" or "Missing environment variables"
- **For Turso**: Check that both Turso environment variables are set correctly
- **Restart your server** after setting environment variables

### "Failed to connect" or "Network error"
- **Check your internet connection**
- **For Turso**: Verify your database URL and auth token are correct
- **Check server logs** for more detailed error messages

### Setup page keeps loading
- **Check that your backend server is running**
- **Verify the backend is accessible** from your browser
- **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors

## Changing Databases Later

**Important**: Once you've set up a database, changing to a different type requires:

1. **Backing up your data** (if you have important information)
2. **Stopping your DeployStack instance**
3. **Removing the database selection file** (`persistent_data/db.selection.json`)
4. **Updating environment variables** for the new database type
5. **Restarting and going through setup again**

**Note**: This will reset your application data, so make sure to backup anything important first.

## Getting Help

If you're having trouble with database setup:

1. **Check the server logs** for detailed error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Ensure your server has internet access** (for cloud databases)
4. **Contact support** with your error messages and setup details

## Security Notes

- **Keep your API tokens secure** - never share them publicly
- **Use environment variables** - don't put credentials directly in code
- **Regularly rotate API tokens** for cloud databases
- **Backup your SQLite database file** if using SQLite

## Next Steps

After successful database setup:

1. **Create your administrator account**
2. **Configure your application settings**
3. **Set up user authentication** (email, GitHub, etc.)
4. **Invite your team members**

Your DeployStack instance is now ready to use!
