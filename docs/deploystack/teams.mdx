# Teams

Teams are the organizational foundation of DeployStack, serving as dedicated workspaces where you manage all your MCP server deployments, cloud provider credentials, and environment variables. Think of teams as isolated containers that keep your deployment resources organized and secure.

## Overview

In DeployStack, teams provide:

- **Isolated Workspaces**: Each team maintains its own separate environment for deployments
- **Resource Organization**: All your MCP servers, credentials, and settings are organized within teams
- **Access Control**: Team-based permissions ensure secure access to your deployment resources
- **Multi-Project Support**: Create up to 3 teams to organize different projects or environments

Every team acts as a complete deployment environment, containing everything needed to deploy and manage MCP servers across various cloud providers.

## Getting Started with Teams

### Automatic Team Creation

When you register for DeployStack, a default team is automatically created for you:

- **Team Name**: Uses your username
- **Team Slug**: A URL-friendly version of your username (e.g., `john-doe`)
- **Description**: Automatically set as "[username]'s team"
- **Role**: You become the Team Administrator with full control

This default team is immediately ready for use - you can start deploying MCP servers right away.

### Team Limits

Each user can create and manage up to **3 teams total**, including your default team. This means you can create 2 additional teams beyond your automatically created default team.

## What Teams Contain

Teams serve as comprehensive containers for all your deployment resources:

### MCP Server Settings
- All deployed MCP server configurations
- Server deployment history and status
- Custom server settings and parameters
- Deployment logs and monitoring data

### Cloud Provider Credentials
- **Render.com**: API tokens and service configurations
- **Fly.io**: Authentication tokens and app settings
- **Other Providers**: Credentials for additional supported platforms

### Global Environment Variables
- **Node.js Environment Variables**: Custom env vars for Node.js-based MCP servers
- **Reusable Variables**: Environment variables that can be applied across multiple servers
- **Secure Storage**: All environment variables are encrypted and securely stored

These global environment variables allow you to define common settings once and apply them to multiple MCP servers within the same team, streamlining your deployment process.

## Team Management

### Managing Your Teams

DeployStack provides an intuitive interface for managing your teams through the Teams dashboard.

#### Accessing Team Management

1. **Navigate to Teams**: Go to the Teams section in your dashboard
2. **View Teams Table**: See all your teams with their details
3. **Manage Teams**: Click the "Manage" button next to any team you want to edit

The "Manage" button is available for all teams where you have administrative privileges.

#### Team Management Interface

When you click "Manage" on a team, you'll access a comprehensive management interface that includes:

- **Team Information**: View team ID, creation date, and last update
- **Team Settings**: Edit team name and description
- **Default Team Protection**: Special handling for your default team
- **Team Deletion**: Remove teams you no longer need (with safety protections)

### Creating Additional Teams

To create a new team:

1. Navigate to the Teams section in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Team"
3. Provide a team name and optional description
4. The system automatically generates a unique URL-friendly slug

**Note**: You can only create teams if you haven't reached the 3-team limit.

### Editing Team Details

You can modify your teams through the team management interface:

#### Team Name Editing

- **Regular Teams**: You can freely change the name of teams you created
- **Default Teams**: Your automatically created default team name **cannot be changed**
- **Protection Indicator**: Default teams show a lock icon with an explanation
- **Reason**: This prevents confusion since your default team name matches your username

#### Team Description Editing

- **All Teams**: You can edit descriptions for any team you administer
- **No Restrictions**: This applies to both default and regular teams
- **Optional Field**: Descriptions can be left empty if desired

#### Visual Indicators

The interface provides clear visual feedback:

- **Default Team Badge**: Shows "Default Team" label for your original team
- **Lock Icons**: Appear next to fields that cannot be edited
- **Explanatory Text**: Describes why certain fields are protected
- **Form Validation**: Prevents invalid changes and provides helpful error messages

### Team Naming and Slugs

- **Team Names**: Can contain spaces, special characters, and any readable text
- **Team Slugs**: Automatically generated URL-friendly identifiers
- **Unique Slugs**: If a slug already exists, the system adds a number (e.g., `my-team-2`)
- **Permanent Slugs**: Once created, team slugs cannot be changed

### Team Ownership

- **Team Owner**: The user who created the team has full administrative control
- **Owner Privileges**: Can modify all team settings, manage resources, and delete the team
- **Single Owner**: Each team has exactly one owner (currently you)

## Team Features

### Current Structure

DeployStack teams currently operate with a **single-user model**:

- Each team belongs to one user
- You have full control over your teams
- No team sharing or collaboration features (planned for future releases)

### Team Roles

Within your teams, you automatically have the **Team Administrator** role, which provides:

- Full access to all team resources
- Ability to deploy and manage MCP servers
- Permission to modify team settings
- Authority to delete the team

*Note: Team User roles exist in the system for future multi-user team functionality.*

### Resource Isolation

Each team maintains complete isolation:

- **Separate Credentials**: Cloud provider credentials are team-specific
- **Independent Servers**: MCP servers in one team don't affect others
- **Isolated Variables**: Environment variables are scoped to individual teams
- **Secure Boundaries**: No cross-team access to resources

## Working with Teams

### Step-by-Step Team Management

#### Editing a Team

1. **Navigate to Teams**: Go to your Teams dashboard
2. **Find Your Team**: Locate the team you want to edit in the table
3. **Click Manage**: Click the "Manage" button in the Actions column
4. **Edit Details**: 
   - Modify the team name (if not a default team)
   - Update the team description
   - Save your changes
5. **Confirmation**: You'll see a success message when changes are saved

#### Deleting a Team (Non-Default Only)

1. **Prepare the Team**: Remove all MCP servers and configurations
2. **Access Management**: Click "Manage" on the team you want to delete
3. **Find Danger Zone**: Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section
4. **Click Delete**: Click the "Delete Team" button
5. **Confirm Action**: In the popup dialog, confirm you want to delete the team
6. **Final Warning**: Read the warning about permanent data loss
7. **Complete Deletion**: Click "Delete" in the confirmation dialog

#### Understanding Team Status

- **Default Team Badge**: Your original team shows a "Default Team" badge
- **Lock Icons**: Indicate fields that cannot be edited
- **Member Count**: Shows how many users are in each team (currently always 1)
- **Last Updated**: Displays when the team was last modified

### Switching Between Teams

If you have multiple teams, you can switch between them to:

- Access different sets of MCP servers
- Use different cloud provider credentials
- Apply different environment variable sets
- Organize projects or environments separately

### Managing Team Settings

For each team, you can:

- **Update Team Name**: Modify the display name
- **Edit Description**: Change or add team descriptions
- **Manage Credentials**: Add, update, or remove cloud provider credentials
- **Configure Variables**: Set up global environment variables
- **Monitor Deployments**: View all MCP servers and their status

### Understanding Team Slugs

Team slugs serve as unique identifiers:

- **URL Component**: Used in dashboard URLs and API endpoints
- **Permanent Identifier**: Cannot be changed after team creation
- **Conflict Resolution**: System automatically handles naming conflicts
- **Case Insensitive**: Converted to lowercase with hyphens

## Team Deletion and Consequences

⚠️ **Critical Warning**: Team deletion is permanent and irreversible.

### Default Team Protection

**Your default team cannot be deleted** - this is a permanent protection:

- **No Delete Option**: The deletion section won't appear for default teams
- **Safety Measure**: Prevents accidental loss of your primary workspace
- **Alternative**: You can still edit the description and manage all resources

### Protection Mechanisms

For non-default teams, multiple safety measures protect against accidental deletion:

1. **Active Server Check**: Teams with active MCP servers **cannot be deleted**
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: A modal dialog requires explicit confirmation
3. **Clear Warning**: The interface clearly explains the consequences
4. **Two-Step Process**: You must first remove all servers, then confirm deletion

### Required Steps Before Deletion

To delete a non-default team, you must:

1. **Stop All Running MCP Servers**: Ensure no servers are currently deployed or running
2. **Remove All Server Configurations**: Delete all MCP server settings and configurations
3. **Access Danger Zone**: Navigate to the "Danger Zone" section in team management
4. **Confirm Deletion**: Click delete and confirm in the popup dialog

### What Gets Permanently Deleted

When you delete a team, you lose **everything** associated with it:

- **All MCP Server Settings**: Complete server configurations and deployment history
- **All Cloud Provider Credentials**: Stored API keys, tokens, and authentication data
- **All Global Environment Variables**: Custom environment settings and variables
- **Complete Deployment History**: Logs, monitoring data, and historical information

### No Recovery Options

**Team deletion is permanent** - there are no backups, recovery options, or ways to restore deleted teams. Once deleted, all data is gone forever.

## Team Permissions

Your team permissions determine what actions you can perform:

### Global vs Team Permissions

- **Global Permissions**: Control system-wide access (user management, global settings)
- **Team Permissions**: Control what you can do within your teams

### Team-Related Permissions

- **`teams.create`**: Create new teams (up to your limit)
- **`teams.view`**: View team details and resources
- **`teams.edit`**: Modify team settings and configurations
- **`teams.delete`**: Delete teams (after removing all servers)
- **`teams.manage`**: Full team management capabilities

### Deployment Capabilities

Your team role affects your ability to:

- Deploy new MCP servers
- Modify server configurations
- Manage cloud provider credentials
- Set up environment variables
- Monitor deployment status
- Access deployment logs

## Getting the Most from Teams

### Organization Strategies

Consider creating separate teams for:

- **Different Projects**: Organize MCP servers by project or client

### Resource Management

Within each team:

- **Group Related Servers**: Deploy related MCP servers in the same team
- **Shared Credentials**: Use the same cloud provider credentials across servers
- **Common Variables**: Leverage global environment variables for consistency
- **Logical Organization**: Use descriptive names and descriptions

Teams provide the foundation for organized, secure, and efficient MCP server deployment in DeployStack. By understanding how teams work, you can effectively manage your deployment resources and maintain clean separation between different projects and environments.
