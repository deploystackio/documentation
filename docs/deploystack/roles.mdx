# User Roles and Permissions

DeployStack uses a role-based system to control what different users can do in your installation. This guide explains how roles work and how to manage user access.

## What are User Roles?

User roles determine what actions a person can perform in DeployStack. Think of roles as "job titles" that come with specific permissions. Each user is assigned one role that defines their level of access.

## Available Roles

### Global Administrator
**Who needs this**: The person responsible for managing the entire DeployStack installation.

**What they can do**:
- Manage all users (create, edit, delete)
- Configure global settings (email, authentication, system options)
- Manage roles and permissions
- Access all system features
- Manage all teams

**Important**: The first person to register automatically becomes a Global Administrator.

### Global User
**Who needs this**: Regular users who want to deploy applications.

**What they can do**:
- View and edit their own profile
- Create up to 3 teams
- Manage their own teams
- Deploy applications through their teams

**Note**: This is the default role for new users.

### Team Administrator
**Who needs this**: Users who manage specific teams within the organization.

**What they can do**:
- Manage their team's settings
- View team members
- Manage team deployments
- Delete teams they own

### Team User
**Who needs this**: Basic team members who participate in deployments.

**What they can do**:
- View team information
- See team members
- Participate in team activities

## Understanding Teams

Teams are groups where users organize their deployment projects. Here's how teams work:

### Team Basics
- **Automatic Team**: Every user gets their own team when they register
- **Team Limit**: Users can create up to 3 teams total
- **Team Owner**: The person who created the team has full control
- **Single User Teams**: Currently, each team has one user (multi-user teams coming soon)

### Team Management
- **Create Teams**: Use descriptive names for your different projects
- **Team Settings**: Customize team name and description
- **Team Deletion**: Only team owners can delete teams

## Common Role Scenarios

### Personal Use
- **You are**: Global Administrator (first user) or Global User
- **Your teams**: Use your default team for personal projects
- **Additional teams**: Create separate teams for different types of projects

### Small Team
- **Administrator**: One person manages the system and users
- **Team Members**: Everyone else is a Global User with their own teams
- **Collaboration**: Users can share deployment information outside the system

### Organization
- **System Admin**: Global Administrator manages the DeployStack installation
- **Project Leads**: Team Administrators manage specific project teams
- **Developers**: Global Users participate in deployments

## Managing User Roles

### As a Global Administrator

**To view all users**:
1. Go to User Management in your admin panel
2. See list of all registered users with their roles

**To change a user's role**:
1. Find the user in the user list
2. Click on their role
3. Select the new role from the dropdown
4. Save changes

**To create new users** (if needed):
1. Use the "Create User" option
2. Fill in their information
3. Assign appropriate role
4. User receives login information

### Managing Your Own Profile
All users can:
- View their profile information
- Update their name and email
- Change their password
- See their current role (but not change it)

## Team Management

### Creating Teams
1. **Go to Teams** in your dashboard
2. **Click "Create Team"**
3. **Enter team name** and description
4. **Save** - you become the team owner automatically

### Managing Your Teams
- **Edit team details**: Update name and description
- **View team information**: See team settings and members
- **Delete teams**: Remove teams you no longer need

### Team Limitations
- **3 Team Maximum**: You can only create 3 teams total
- **One User per Team**: Teams currently support single users
- **Owner Control**: Only team owners can modify team settings

## Security and Access Control

### What Roles Protect
- **System Settings**: Only administrators can change global configuration
- **User Management**: Only administrators can create, edit, or delete users
- **Team Ownership**: Only team owners can modify their teams
- **Profile Privacy**: Users can only edit their own profiles

### Role Assignment Rules
- **First User**: Automatically becomes Global Administrator
- **New Users**: Get Global User role by default
- **Self-Assignment**: Users cannot change their own roles
- **Admin Assignment**: Only administrators can change user roles

## Troubleshooting Roles and Teams

### Can't Access Settings
**Problem**: "I don't see the Settings option"
**Solution**: Only Global Administrators can access system settings. Contact your administrator.

### Can't Create Teams
**Problem**: "Create Team button is disabled"
**Solution**: You may have reached the 3-team limit. Delete unused teams or contact your administrator.

### Can't Change Role
**Problem**: "I want to be an administrator"
**Solution**: Only existing administrators can assign roles. Ask your current administrator to change your role.

### Lost Administrator Access
**Problem**: "No one has administrator access"
**Solution**: This requires technical intervention. Contact your system administrator or technical support.

## Best Practices

### For Administrators
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review user roles and remove inactive users
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give users the minimum role needed for their tasks
- **Documentation**: Keep track of who has what role and why
- **Backup Access**: Ensure at least two people have administrator access

### For Team Management
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear team names that reflect their purpose
- **Regular Cleanup**: Delete teams you no longer use
- **Organization**: Consider how to organize your projects across teams

### For Security
- **Role Changes**: Think carefully before changing someone's role
- **Team Ownership**: Be aware that team owners have full control over their teams
- **Profile Information**: Keep your profile information current

## Getting Help

If you have questions about roles or teams:

- **Role Questions**: Contact your Global Administrator
- **Technical Issues**: Visit our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/UjFWwByB)
- **Feature Requests**: Let us know what team features you'd like to see

Remember: The role system is designed to be simple but secure. Most users will be happy as Global Users with their own teams, while administrators handle system-wide configuration.
