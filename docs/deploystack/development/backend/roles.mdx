# Role-Based Access Control System

This document describes the role-based access control (RBAC) system implemented in the DeployStack backend.

## Overview

The RBAC system provides fine-grained access control through roles and permissions. It supports:

- **Global Roles**: System-wide roles that control access to administrative functions
- **Permission-Based Access**: Granular permissions for specific actions
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new roles and permissions
- **Secure Defaults**: Safe fallbacks and protection against privilege escalation

## Default Roles

### Global Administrator (`global_admin`)

- **Description**: Full system access with user management capabilities
- **Permissions**:
  - `users.list` - List all users
  - `users.view` - View user details
  - `users.edit` - Edit user information
  - `users.delete` - Delete users
  - `users.create` - Create new users
  - `roles.manage` - Manage roles and permissions
  - `system.admin` - Administrative system access
  - `settings.view` - View global application settings
  - `settings.edit` - Create and update global application settings
  - `settings.delete` - Delete global application settings
  - `teams.create` - Create new teams
  - `teams.view` - View team details
  - `teams.edit` - Edit team settings
  - `teams.delete` - Delete teams
  - `teams.manage` - Full team management
  - `team.members.view` - View team members
  - `team.members.manage` - Manage team member roles

**Note**: Global administrators have special access to view cloud credentials metadata across all teams, but cannot perform CRUD operations or view credential values. Cloud credentials management is team-contextual.

### Global User (`global_user`)

- **Description**: Standard user with basic profile access
- **Permissions**:
  - `profile.view` - View own profile
  - `profile.edit` - Edit own profile
  - `teams.create` - Create new teams (up to 3)
  - `teams.view` - View team details
  - `teams.edit` - Edit own team settings
  - `teams.delete` - Delete own teams
  - `team.members.view` - View team members

### Team Administrator (`team_admin`)

- **Description**: Full management access within a specific team
- **Permissions**:
  - `teams.view` - View team details
  - `teams.edit` - Edit team settings
  - `teams.delete` - Delete team (if owner)
  - `teams.manage` - Full team management
  - `team.members.view` - View team members
  - `team.members.manage` - Manage team member roles

### Team User (`team_user`)

- **Description**: Basic team member with limited access
- **Permissions**:
  - `teams.view` - View team details
  - `team.members.view` - View team members

## Team System

DeployStack includes a comprehensive team management system that allows users to organize their work into teams and collaborate with other users. Each user automatically gets their own team upon registration and can create up to 3 teams total.

### Team Features

- **Automatic Team Creation**: Every new user gets a default team created with their username
- **Team Ownership**: Each team has an owner who has full administrative control
- **Multi-User Teams**: Teams support up to 3 members with role-based access control
- **Team Limits**: Users can create up to 3 teams maximum
- **Unique Slugs**: Teams have URL-friendly slugs with automatic conflict resolution
- **Default Team Protection**: Default teams cannot have additional members added (personal workspace)

### Team Database Schema

#### Teams Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  slug TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  owner_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES authUser(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

#### Team Memberships Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE teamMemberships (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  team_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES authUser(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'team_admin' or 'team_user'
  joined_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(team_id, user_id)
);
```

### Team Registration Flow

When a user registers:

1. User account is created with appropriate global role
2. A default team is automatically created using the user's username
3. The user is added as `team_admin` of their new team
4. If username conflicts exist, slug gets incremented (e.g., `john-doe-2`)

### Team Management

#### Team Creation

- Users can create up to 3 teams
- Team names are converted to URL-friendly slugs
- Automatic conflict resolution for duplicate slugs
- Team owner becomes `team_admin` automatically

#### Default Team Protection

- **Default Team Identification**: Teams created during user registration (name matches username)
- **Name Protection**: Default team names cannot be changed via API or UI
- **Deletion Protection**: Default teams cannot be deleted
- **Description Editing**: Default team descriptions can still be modified
- **UI Indicators**: Frontend shows lock icons and explanatory text for protected fields

#### Team Roles

- **Team Admin**: Full control over team settings and management
- **Team User**: Basic team member (for future expansion)

#### Team Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `teams.create` | Create new teams (up to limit) |
| `teams.view` | View team details |
| `teams.edit` | Edit team settings |
| `teams.delete` | Delete team |
| `teams.manage` | Full team management |
| `team.members.view` | View team members |
| `team.members.manage` | Manage team member roles |

#### Cloud Credentials Permissions (Team-Contextual)

Cloud credentials are team-scoped resources with role-based access control. Unlike other permissions, cloud credentials access is determined by team membership and role, not global permissions.

**Access Control Matrix:**

| Role | Team Access | Can See | Can Do | Secret Values |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| `global_admin` | Any team | Metadata only (name, provider, dates) | List/View only | ❌ Never |
| `team_admin` | Own teams only | Metadata + non-secret field values | Full CRUD | ❌ Never |
| `team_user` | Own teams only | Metadata only (name, provider, dates) | Read only | ❌ Never |
| `global_user` | No access | Nothing | Nothing | ❌ Never |

**Security Rules:**

- **Team Membership Required**: Only team members can access team's cloud credentials (except global admins)
- **Secret Values Protected**: No role can view secret credential values via API
- **Team Isolation**: Users can only access credentials from teams they belong to
- **Role-Based Responses**: API responses vary based on user's role within the team

**Response Examples:**

```typescript
// Team Admin Response (can see non-secret values)
{
  "fields": {
    "access_key_id": {
      "hasValue": true,
      "secret": false,
      "value": "AKIATEST123456789"  // ✅ Non-secret shown
    },
    "secret_access_key": {
      "hasValue": true,
      "secret": true
      // ❌ No "value" field - secret never shown
    }
  }
}

// Team User Response (metadata only)
{
  "id": "cred123",
  "name": "Production AWS",
  "provider": { "name": "Amazon Web Services" },
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  // ❌ No "fields" object - no values shown
}

// Global Admin Response (metadata only, any team)
{
  "fields": {
    "access_key_id": {
      "hasValue": true,
      "secret": false
      // ❌ No "value" field - admin sees no values
    },
    "secret_access_key": {
      "hasValue": true,
      "secret": true
      // ❌ No "value" field - admin sees no values
    }
  }

const updatedTeam = await TeamService.updateTeam(teamId, {
  name: 'New Name',
  description: 'New description'
});

// Delete team
const deleted = await TeamService.deleteTeam(teamId);

// Check team limits
const canCreate = await TeamService.canUserCreateTeam(userId);

// Team membership checks
const isAdmin = await TeamService.isTeamAdmin(teamId, userId);
const isOwner = await TeamService.isTeamOwner(teamId, userId);
const isMember = await TeamService.isTeamMember(teamId, userId);

// Default team checks
const isDefault = await TeamService.isDefaultTeam(teamId, userId);

const isTeamDefault = await TeamService.isTeamDefault(teamId);
```

### Frontend Team Management

The system includes a comprehensive team management interface:

#### Teams List Page (`/teams`)

- Displays all user's teams in a data table
- Shows team name, description, creation date, and member count
- Includes "Manage" button for team administrators
- Uses shadcn/ui components for consistent styling

#### Team Management Page (`/teams/manage/:id`)

- **URL Pattern**: `/teams/manage/{teamId}`
- **Access Control**: Only team administrators can access
- **Design**: Matches admin interface styling (`/admin/users/:id`)
- **Features**:
  - Team information display (ID, creation date, update date)
  - Editable team name (disabled for default teams with lock icon)
  - Editable team description (always available)
  - Default team badge and explanations
  - Danger zone with team deletion (protected for default teams)
  - Confirmation modal for team deletion using shadcn dialog

#### UI Components

```typescript
// Team management form validation
const teamSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Team name is required'),
  description: z.string().optional()
});

// Default team protection in UI
const isDefaultTeam = computed(() => {
  return team.value?.name === user.value?.username;
});
```

#### Internationalization

Complete i18n support with translation keys:

- `teams.manage.title` - Page title
- `teams.manage.defaultTeam.badge` - Default team indicator
- `teams.manage.form.name.disabled` - Lock explanation
- `teams.manage.dangerZone.title` - Deletion section
- `teams.manage.delete.confirmation` - Confirmation dialog

## Permission System

### Available Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `users.list` | List all users in the system |
| `users.view` | View detailed user information |
| `users.edit` | Edit user information and assign roles |
| `users.delete` | Delete user accounts |
| `users.create` | Create new user accounts |
| `roles.manage` | Create, update, and delete roles |
| `system.admin` | Administrative system access |
| `settings.view` | View global application settings |
| `settings.edit` | Create and update global application settings |
| `settings.delete` | Delete global application settings |
| `profile.view` | View own profile information |
| `profile.edit` | Edit own profile information |
| `teams.create` | Create new teams (up to limit) |
| `teams.view` | View team details |
| `teams.edit` | Edit team settings |
| `teams.delete` | Delete team |
| `teams.manage` | Full team management |
| `team.members.view` | View team members |
| `team.members.manage` | Manage team member roles |

### Permission Checking

The system provides several ways to check permissions:

#### Middleware Functions

```typescript
import { requirePermission, requireRole, requireGlobalAdmin } from '../middleware/roleMiddleware';

// Require specific permission
fastify.get('/admin-only', {
  preHandler: requirePermission('system.admin')
}, handler);

// Require specific role
fastify.get('/admin-role', {
  preHandler: requireRole('global_admin')
}, handler);

// Require global admin (shorthand)
fastify.get('/global-admin', {
  preHandler: requireGlobalAdmin()
}, handler);
```

#### Utility Functions

```typescript
import { checkUserPermission, getUserRole } from '../middleware/roleMiddleware';

// Check permission programmatically
const hasPermission = await checkUserPermission(userId, 'users.edit');

// Get user's role information
const userRole = await getUserRole(userId);
```

## User Registration Flow

### First User

When the first user registers in the system:

1. They are automatically assigned the `global_admin` role
2. This ensures there's always at least one administrator

### Subsequent Users

All subsequent users are assigned the `global_user` role by default.

### Registration Code Example

```typescript
// Check if this is the first user
const allUsers = await db.select().from(authUserTable).limit(1);
const isFirstUser = allUsers.length === 0;
const defaultRole = isFirstUser ? 'global_admin' : 'global_user';

// Create user with appropriate role
await db.insert(authUserTable).values({
  // ... other user data
  role_id: defaultRole
});
```

## Security Considerations

### Role Protection

- **System Roles**: Cannot be modified or deleted
- **Last Admin Protection**: Cannot delete the last global administrator
- **Self-Role Protection**: Users cannot change their own roles
- **Self-Delete Protection**: Users cannot delete their own accounts

### Permission Validation

- All permissions are validated against a whitelist
- Invalid permissions are rejected during role creation/update
- Database constraints ensure referential integrity

### Session Security

- Role information is fetched fresh for each permission check
- No role caching to prevent stale permission issues
- Lucia v3 handles secure session management

## Adding New Roles

### 1. Define Permissions

First, add any new permissions to the available permissions list:

```typescript
// In services/backend/src/routes/roles/schemas.ts
export const AVAILABLE_PERMISSIONS = [
  // ... existing permissions
  'content.moderate',
  'reports.view',
  'analytics.access',
] as const;
```

### 2. Create Role via API

Use the role creation API to add new roles:

```http
POST /api/roles
{
  "id": "content_moderator",
  "name": "Content Moderator",
  "description": "Manages user-generated content",
  "permissions": ["users.view", "content.moderate", "reports.view"]
}
```

### 3. Update Default Permissions (Optional)

If you want to include the role in default setups:

```typescript
// In services/backend/src/services/roleService.ts
static getDefaultPermissions() {
  return {
    global_admin: [/* ... */],
    global_user: [/* ... */],
    content_moderator: ['users.view', 'content.moderate', 'reports.view'],
  };
}
```

## Migration and Setup

### Database Migration

The role system is set up through migration `0003_huge_prism.sql` (generated using `npm run db:generate`):

1. Creates the `roles` table
2. Adds `role_id` column to `authUser` table
3. Seeds default roles (`global_admin`, `global_user`)
4. Assigns existing users to `global_user`
5. Promotes the first user to `global_admin`

### Manual Setup

If you need to manually set up roles:

```sql
-- Insert default roles
INSERT INTO roles (id, name, description, permissions, is_system_role, created_at, updated_at) VALUES 
('global_admin', 'Global Administrator', 'Full system access', '["users.list","users.view","users.edit","users.delete","users.create","roles.manage","system.admin"]', 1, strftime('%s', 'now') * 1000, strftime('%s', 'now') * 1000),
('global_user', 'Global User', 'Standard user access', '["profile.view","profile.edit"]', 1, strftime('%s', 'now') * 1000, strftime('%s', 'now') * 1000);

-- Assign roles to users
UPDATE authUser SET role_id = 'global_user' WHERE role_id IS NULL;
UPDATE authUser SET role_id = 'global_admin' WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM authUser ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Denied Errors

- Verify the user has the required permission
- Check if the user's role includes the necessary permission
- Ensure the role exists and is properly assigned

#### Role Assignment Failures

- Verify the target role exists
- Check if you're trying to assign a role to yourself (not allowed)
- Ensure you have `users.edit` permission

#### Migration Issues

- Ensure the database is properly initialized
- Check that previous migrations have been applied
- Verify foreign key constraints are working

### Debug Commands

```typescript
// Check user's current role and permissions
const userRole = await roleService.getUserRole(userId);
logger.info('User role:', userRole);

// Check specific permission
const hasPermission = await roleService.userHasPermission(userId, 'users.edit');
logger.info('Has permission:', hasPermission);

// List all roles
const allRoles = await roleService.getAllRoles();
logger.info('All roles:', allRoles);
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Hierarchical Roles**: Parent-child role relationships
- **Temporary Permissions**: Time-limited access grants
- **Permission Groups**: Logical grouping of related permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Track role and permission changes
- **Role Templates**: Predefined role configurations

### Extension Points

The system is designed to be extensible:

- Add new permissions by updating the `AVAILABLE_PERMISSIONS` array
- Create custom middleware for complex permission logic
- Implement role-based UI components in the frontend
- Add role-specific business logic in services

## Best Practices

### Role Design

- Keep roles focused and specific
- Use descriptive names and descriptions
- Group related permissions logically
- Avoid overly broad permissions

### Permission Naming

- Use dot notation for hierarchy (`users.edit`, `content.moderate`)
- Be specific about the action (`view`, `edit`, `delete`, `create`)
- Use consistent naming patterns

### Security

- Always check permissions at the API level
- Don't rely solely on frontend permission checks
- Regularly audit role assignments
- Monitor for privilege escalation attempts

### Performance

- Permission checks are lightweight but avoid excessive calls
- Consider caching user roles for high-frequency operations
- Use middleware for route-level protection
- Batch permission checks when possible
