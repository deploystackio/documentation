# docker-to-iac Available Commands

The following commands are currently supported:

## Build Commands

- `npm run build`
  - Builds the module using TypeScript compiler and creates output files inside the `dist/` directory.

## Code Quality Commands

- `npm run lint`
  - Runs ESLint to check code quality. ESLint is also run as part of GitHub action test for new pull requests on the default `main` branch.

## Testing Commands

- `npm run test`
  - Runs the complete test suite including both unit tests and end-to-end tests.
- `npm run test:unit`
  - Runs only the unit tests to validate individual components.
- `npm run test:e2e`
  - Runs only the end-to-end tests which validate the entire translation process from Docker run commands or Docker Compose files to infrastructure as code.
- `npm run test:watch`
  - Runs tests in watch mode, which automatically re-runs tests when files change.
- `npm run test:coverage`
  - Runs tests with coverage reporting to identify untested code paths.

## Release Commands

- `npm run release`
  - Runs the release-it command which is part of the release process of [docker-to-iac](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deploystack/docker-to-iac) modules to npm registry. The release is executed through configurations defined in `.release-it.js`.

## Other Commands

- `npm run pretest:e2e`
  - Automatically run before e2e tests to clean the output directory.

You can view all commands and their configurations in the [package.json](https://github.com/deploystackio/docker-to-iac/blob/main/package.json) file.

## Examples

### Running Unit Tests Only

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Running End-to-End Tests Only

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Running All Tests with Coverage

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Building the Module

```bash
npm run build
```

### Checking Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint
```

Each command is configured to provide the most relevant feedback for its purpose. For example, unit tests provide detailed output about each individual function, while end-to-end tests show a summary of the complete translation process from Docker configurations to infrastructure as code.
